The phone is good. Battery is awesome. Front camera is good according to 2 MP and rear camera is not very good but also not very bad. Screen resolution, response & sound is also very good. I love its back cover which comes free in the box with the phone. In short, its worth buying.
FASTASTIC PHONE AT THIS PRICE.ITS JUST AWSME. BATTERY AND CAMERA IS GOOD. NO HANGING AS QUAD CORE PROCESSOR .
not good quality product its open the box and start hanging and restart the problem
Very Good phone! with long battery life!
Good. But only one problem charging is not keep up that.
Very Nice Phone at low price !!! also good camera
waste of money, instead -good bet is Samsung equivalent or micromax. I bought this phone, speaker phone is faulty , display is not good, touch response is slow. Intermittent problem of radiation noise in the speaker phone. I bought from a reseller in gandhi bazaar . Not getting replacement nor any solution .... Regret buying it....
Worth to Buy!
