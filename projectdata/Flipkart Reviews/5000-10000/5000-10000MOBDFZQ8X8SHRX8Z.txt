This is a very nice mobile and this is a perfect mobile for me as a music lover , white color mobile gives a nice rich look than blue or orange coloured mobile , wifi ,3g and gprs has a nice speed in surfing or downloading , No other samsung mobile gives nice audio experience than this mobile as it contains SRS Surround Sound, SoundAlive Solution , camera is very nice , audio through speaker is loud with clarity , battery backup is nice and better than y duos in this price range , Touch is very nice and it supports temple run game , The only negative is its screen it is 3.0 inches and 320*240 pixels .
- As other buyers stated MUSIC BUTTON IS ANNOYING *the button works even when phone is locked,accidental presses when you take from your pocket will result in resuming playback of last played file. _________________________________________________________ DISABLE MUSIC BUTTON __________________________________________________________ READ BELOW ONLY IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO THE STEPS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHATEVER HAPPENS TO YOUR PHONE. THIS IS NOT REAL DISABLING,INSTEAD MUSIC BUTTON WILL LAUNCH MUSIC PLAYER,THIS FIX REMOVES ALL FILES FROM MUSIC PLAYER (DEFAULT PLAYER WHICH IS OPENED BY MUSIC BUTTON), HENCE PRESSING OF BUTTON WONT RESULT IN PLAYBACK. APPLICATION NEEDED ____________________ 1. OI FILE MANAGER (its free, You can use file manager of your choice if it supports renaming a file including extension) eg:- say you have 1.txt file , if you use file manager that comes with your phone , it will only rename filename, you cant change TXT extension to your wish. STEPS ____________ (READ THE WHOLE STEPS COMPLETELY BEFORE DOING ON PHONE ,DO THE STEPS IN YOUR PHONE IN THE SECOND READING) 1. Create a txt file in your computer(name doesnt matter) copy it to the folder where your songs are stored 2. Now open OI file manager, navigate to the songs folder, select the txt file we copied , rename it to .nomedia (Remember,There is a dot before nomedia) 3.Exit OI file manager ( BEFORE YOU DO STEP 4,I HAVE TO SAY AFTER STEP 4, YOUR PHONES RINGTONE AND NOTIFICATION WOULD BE SILENT AUTOMATICALLY,IF YOU TRY TO CHANGE RINGTONE YOU WOULD SEE A LIST ,WHICH ONLY HAVE ONE OPTION (SILENT) DONT PANIC,PROCEED TO STEP 5 ) 4.Go to settings->Application Manager->All->Media Storage->Clear Data. 5.Shutdown phone,then turn on again.(WAIT SOME MINUTES [IF YOU HAVE LARGE SD CARD WITH LOT OF FILES ,YOU HAVE TO WAIT MORE MINUTES] AFTER REACHING HOME SCREEN AS MEDIA STORAGE HAVE TO LOAD FILENAMES INTO RINGTONES LIST , THEN GO TO SOUNDS TO SET RINGTONE AND NOTIFICATION , DONT FORGET ) 6. Whenever you add new file to the music folder with .nomedia, the newly added file (ONLY) is loaded into mediastorage ,hence the mp3 player will load the lastly added file or files automatically.In that case you have to do step 4 and step 5. ______________________________________________________________ WHY WE CREATED .nomedia FILE? _______________________________________________________________ if you put .nomedia file inside a folder,mediastorage will ignore the folder contents that have .nomedia file inside it. mp3 player that works by music button uses mediastorage for files,if media storage ignores your mp3 folder, media storage wont have mp3filenames hence music player wont automatically load mp3 to playlist. ____________________________________________________________ WHY DATA DELETION FROM MEDIASTORAGE SETTINGS? _____________________________________________________________ We have to wipe out all the filenames read from mp3 folder which was read automatically before .nomedia file in folder. This will not result in deletion of actual files but just file names stored in media storage After rebooting , media storage will scan again through all folder building index of all medias (videos , ringtones,...) excluding any folder that have .nomedia. ______________________________________________________ ISSUE SOLVED , HOW CAN I LISTEN TO MY MUSIC FOLDER _______________________________________________________ By installing any mp3 player that have folder support. Beam player is a SIMPLE player with folder support that is FREE from play store. PowerAmp also supports folders PAID APP with TRIAL option.
overall a value 4 money phone.. 1. phone doesnt hangs, but some time lags(common in this range) 2. price is really good as far competitors are concern cheapest in all (sony tipo , htc desire c) 3 . It had Gps with Glonass ( no company one has given in this range phones) 4. camera is good has touch focus 5. best thing abt this phone is its dual stand by but when acts as active like if u r on sim one and u got a call on 2nd it wont tell the caller than its out of reach instead it will tranfer/divert to active one.. 6. Sound is really good and clear. 7 Sar value is very less .79 w/kg as competitors have more than 1w/kg 8 it does not have ambient light sensor and gyroscope(tilting wont work). 9. keyboard cannont be turned in landscape mode. only potrait..
This phone is just a hype. Main difference is with respect to Music and Dual SIM feature both are sub standard. 1) This phone is not actually Dual SIM active. Dual SIM standby/active should handle call in a SIM when the other SIM is on a call which is not happening in this model, same for samsung Y-duos-lite 5302. You have to enable call forwarding which is operator dependent and comes with a price. 2) Even though its a music phone, the package sans a good in-ear earphone rather it is shipped with a normal earphone which is quite average. Even when I plugged a in-ear earphone, the output was average. 3) Also songs played from sd card drops intermittently, i checked with other SD cards and also with software update. This phone even though touted as 'music duos' is actually bad in both parameters. Looks like a manfacturing defect. 4) Packing doesn't have user manual, one needs to download it from net, which should be avoided. Overall its a OK phone. Good for 1st time Android users, you will get android 4 for this price. if you are used to SONY / Nokia sound quality, don't buy this phone. other than android OS, this phone is a dumb. Not worth the price.
Music breaks or pauses twice or thrice while playing a song. It seems memory issue with this Samsung phone. Other than that I don't feel major issues. U can use it for calls comfortably. Android phone with dual sim feature is good, white color is good looking than blue or yellow.
i bought this mobile after much waiting. it was announced in the first week of october. but the news of such a phone arriving the market came even before that. but it became available in india only in the first week of december. i was happy when it arrived the market at last, but only to be disappointed on purchasing it. the video support is very very poor. let me tell why i am unhappy. 1.the music breaks while playing. there are small pauses occuring two or more times in a single song itself. i tried different memory cards and different songs to make sure that it is not the problem of the memory card or song.took it to service centre. they opened the phone and gave back asking me to come again later. well, each time it is a waste of four or five hours. 2.the earphone audio quality is okay. but when the button available in the earphone mic is pressed while the phone is ringing for incoming calls, the call does not get connected. again the problem is not with the earphone. i tried different earphones at the service centre but no use. the service centre technician did something on the earphone socket and then it was okay. but only for a day. 3.worst of all, it does not play stereo at times. all songs are played in the mono mode or they reproduced through the earphone in that way. most annoying. all the music settings like equalizer etc becomes a mockery when the music is played mono. MY HUMBLE OPINION IS THAT THIS PHONE IS NOT WORTH THIS PRICE. BECAUSE WE DO NOT TOLERATE SUCH TROUBLES IN A PHONE PRICED EVEN TEN PERCENT OF ITS PRICE.
I have used this phone, it works well.. Nice features have been given, Music clarity is good,, Video resolution supported by this phone is better than Galaxy y. One problem - ie.. The screen light blinks simultaneously whether it is locked. Look is also GOOD!!!!!!!
This is the phone in the indian market Just like an iPod Touch with mobile super games free ICS waht else do we need? This is the best smartphone under Rs 9000 Dual sim
You cant get ICS Android at this Range.........other androids at this range lacks in Speed and Music....But Since it is Andro-Music Edition, the Sounds are rocking and Provided Samsung Stereo Headset which has superb base .....Worth buying as from Flipkart too :-)
- Nice one....but battery back is bit low - it should be properly mentioned the size of the internal memory. - 3 MP Camera is somewhat ok. - Dual-Sim + Android OS V4.0.1 + Processor (850 MHz Cortex-A9) + GPRS + EDGE + 3G + WiFi + Navigation(A-GPS, GLONASS) + Others (FM, Good Music players, ...etc) - it is difficult to get all such combinations in NOKIA, but NOKIA has good battery backup
This was my first mobile purchase from online shopping and am impressed by FLIP CART for their Delivery and step by step shipping details. I ordered on 06 July and got the product on 10 July (inducing Sunday) packing was superb totally this was a wonderful online shopping experience with "ONLINE MEGA STORE". thumbs up for u guys. Keep it up.. now coming to the product Samsung galaxy music is the best phone in 5000-6000 range. In 5299 Samsung brand, android ICS 4.0.4, stereo speakers, good head phones. and 4gb memory card That was a great deal. Pros. 1) Good looking with two stereo speakers in front 2) Getting 3G and WiFi in this range 3) good headphones and srs sound is simply superb. 4) decent 3mp camera 5) Good battery life ( for music and daily life style it come 2 days, for internet browsing and video play back it come 1 day under heavy usage) 6) Its body and build quality is different from other Samsung phones nice looking. Cons. 1) poor resolution and ppi 2) 512 ram is not sufficient for android ICS 3) some videos hangs even in MX player. 4) Music butten is good but some time it get irritated. Overall samsung galaxy music is wonderful for music lovers. Go for it if ur budget is 5000-6000. if u want good build quality and long life then go for Nokia Asha 501 in this range(3G Missing) THANK U FLIPCART
The phone is really great and does serve good battery life. The phone supports nearly all apps and the screen size is decent. The music button plays music even when locked but that is not of a big concern if you turn media volume 0 when not in use. Overall a very nice phone.
I Brought the phone when an offer was going on... i cost me Rs 4769.. It was quite economic according to the price... for the first time user of android this is a good phone to choose.. as it is having android 4.0.4(ICS)... Even the phone is not dual core but it doesn't hangs with this android version... if u r a gamer or play high-end video.. it is not good for you..screen size is also good 3 Inches.. for those who don't like big screen phones... iwould rate 4 out of 5.
Everything Comes in Single Mobile at a Price Tag of Rs.4800 after cash back. feeling Awesome.. No other mobile is in this range. only the picture quality of the 3MP Camera is not that in normal light too & battery time are slightly down under heavy usage of internet..
value for money phone and tha sound is just awesome... we can say really this is a music phone.. but when u play video in it it stops in middle...and it is quite slow due to its processor u cant expect much in this price..buT the phone is VALUE FOR MONEY..
I bought this from Flipkart at around May 3rd quarter. This is a nice and superb looking mobile. Usually all Sammy mobiles look the same. But, this one looks different from any other Samsung Mobile: Pros: Looks Good Easy to use(one hand operation is very easy) Good battery life 3.5G, GPS, GLONASS, BT3.0, WiFi, WiFi Direct Good Touch screen Stereo Speakers with loud sound Wireless FM Dedicated Music Player key Cons: Screen pixel density is just ok (not very good for watching videos) After a genuine update, it became slower Camera is fixed focus one Conclusion: If you are looking for a low cost dual sim Smartphone with good features which will satisfy your needs, this is the one for you :-)
I have using this product. Really nice. Working perfectly. It has got android v4.O OS, 3MP camera etc. etc. But lacks in processor(850 MHz cortex A9) and screen(3 inch). But Overall It's a good product. Thank You Flipkart!!!
Got this for only Rs.4770 after applying cashback. I can say this is the best mobie @ this price. No other model has such feature like 512MB RAM, Cortex A9 processor and Android ICS this price. Simply the best deal I could find on flipkart. :-)
Bought it on 30th june and recieved it on 2nd july. Awesome experience with flipkart. Now about the product. Good budget phone with all you can expect at this price ( I bought it around 5000 INR). You will get 445 mb of ramof which u will get around 150 mb free after inserting 2 sims and installing some imp apps. It doesnot lag that much. Cammera is good for this price.battry is also good. Touch is v good. Now games... u can play all angry birds games except star wars. Temple run 1 and 2 are playable but not a great experience with graphics and resolution. But cant expect more. Subway suffers doesnot support on this handset. Wifi connectivity is good. Other issues are already been enlightened by others. So u can go for it. Overall one word. U cant expect more at this price, atleast from a company like samsung. Thankyou for reading.
When it was launched it was for more than 9000, and it was certainly overpriced then. Some correction has taken place lately, and it is now available for 5000 and even a little lower on some sites. It is certainly worth it for this price. I have not encountered the music skipping problem like some other people, and music playback is good. Once it is rooted and some cache cleaning apps are installed, the phone is also quite fast and responsive. So if you are looking for a branded phone which is value for money, this is a good buy. Now it can also be upgraded to official Jelly Bean 4.1.2, just go to http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2415442 for a complete guide.
This phone has turned out to be really good.. all i wanted was a cheap android phone as a backup device.. but i am kind of hooked to it. Pros: The dual speakers are loud enough so that one doesnt miss a call. The camera 3mp camera takes commendable pics in daylight The DLNA feature for streaming videos and audio on led was a feature which came as a bonus in such a low budget phone Headphones are samsung's standard in ear head phones which wont let down music lovers Cons: Screen size is small,,, Resolution is low,, Overall if someone is looking for entry level android device,, and have a budget constraint, then this is a phone to own...
flipkart made me edit my review because I mentioned the price which has very high earlier but now flipkart has corrected the price but I am not happy with the time they take to review their prices. I urge flipkart to review prices of each product on daily basis. You should understand that you are a renowned online store. As far as galaxy music is concerned it is a good budget device. This is only what you get from a branded budget device. Don't expect much performance. Buy it only if you want the name "samsung" written on your device and you are within budget otherwise go for Micromax that is very good and fast upcoming brand. Alternately you can look out for galaxy star, galaxy pocket neo and bit costlier galaxy young. All these are better than music duos with exception that galaxy star lacks 3g. Galaxy Young is the best budget device from Samsung if you can afford to shell out some more money.
my father was looking for a replacement for his second phone. already having an S3 so he didn't want to keep another big one because it gets messy both in hands and pockets. We went to samsung store to check for the options where the salesperson showed us this handset worth Rs 8400/- Dad was looking for a phone to carry easily, speakers to be loud in both aspect music as well as ringtone( YES THEY ARE DAMN LOUD) and basic features like camera, internet. this phone fulfilled our criteria from all the angles and bought from flipkart for Rs 6400/ only. He isnt using internet and other apps because S3 steps in where additional stuff is required but still i have used it and yes it is good to buy also has good touch. Just remember not to load your memory with lots of things because in the end it has got 512 MB Ram so it will slow it down. so keep only those stuff which you use it everyday and keep CLEARING THE RAM MEMORY FROM TASKBAR. it will close all the unwanted apps and increase the battery life too. AND TO GET ADDITIONAL BATTERY LIFE THEN GO IN THE APPLICATIONS AND DISABLE THE APPS WHICH YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO USE. FOR Eg. FEW APPS FROM YAHOO AND SAMSUNG. THEN YOUR PHONE WILL CONSUME LESS BATTERY. P.S: KEEP YOU SOFTWARE UPDATE APP DISABLED ALL THE TIME( ENABLE ONLY WHEN YOU WANT TO UPDATE) AND IN SETTING SELECT " ONLY UPDATE ON Wi-Fi" SO YOUR MOBILE DATA CONNECTION WILL NOT TRY TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER FOR CHECKING UPDATES. IT WILL INCREASES YOUR BATTERY LIFE TOO.
got my first android phone..for years i have been using nokia, but now i understood the reason why samsung is capturing the market first of all i would like to thank flipkart for providing me the product so cheap. in the market and in the samsung showroom and in the samsung website the product is available for rs 8000 but flipkart provided me for only rs 6499. this product is just amazing. i have read a lot of reviews before buying this product and i must say most have told wrong about this product. i have checked all the list below before posting here: advantages of the product: 1) smart dual sim--i have both airtel sim in my mobile..when using net on one sim incoming comes on both the sim 2)sound clarity is superb 3)skype is working with back camera used as camera for the other person to see you. 4)ussd service is fast..one of the reviewers told its not, but i must say it is fast for me atleast. 5)net speed is superb...i have watched live ipl match in youtube with 2g speed 6)touch screen is good disadvantages: 1)the biggest disadvantage is that the music button when pressed(even when the phone is silent or locked) plays the last file 2)till now i could not figure out why sbi mobile banking and irctc application not working 3)video quality is not good
All, I purchased this handset bcz I seduced to its stylished design and features. But this is the worst mobile I think Samsung Yet produced. # First Of all price was very high, purchase @ 8999/- Now the price is R. 6499/- Why The price down suddenly ? Because nobody is going for this handset n company pushing to sell stocks. # Battery Life is less than 1 day. # Internet browsing speed is very less, not compatible to Android 4.0, company is fooling us. I think this is the lowest version of Android 2.0 GB # Music quality is quite good, but handset always hang while playing n browsing internet # Messaging Features is very less. # In short by paying Rs.8999/- I think I hardly received features of Rs.3-4 thousand only. Very Disgusting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bought this Phone after reading lot of reviews and comments from Flipkart last month. As usual the package arrived in time, well packed, safe and in order. 1. However when i switched on the device and started using after charging it for 8 hours, I was shocked to find that the internal memory is only 1.85 GB and not 4GB. Again I checked the product specification and found that it is mentioned as 4GB. When I asked Flipkart regarding this, someone called me and informed me that the remaining 2.15 GB is utilised by the Android OS. I may not be a computer Geek but don't tell me the size of OS is 2.15GB. 2. The battery is not that good. First it gets heated up. and drains soon. Not as promised. 3. While playing some games, the game automatically gets paused and play again. sometimes hangs too. 4. The sound button found on the right side bottom works even when phone is locked. So if we press the button unknowingly, the songs start to play. 5. Good thing about the phone is the sound system is very good. 6. The design of the phone is very nice. The look of the phone is very attractive. I wouldn't have been this disappointed if they have clearly mentioned the phone's internal memory size as 1.85 GB instead of misleading me by saying 4GB.
this mobile has a 3 inch display with 262k colors it has a 3 mp camera, touch wiz ux (in sgs3 and note 2)dual speakers in built radio antenna , android 4.0.4 up gradable to 4.1(as Samsung says) 850 MHz cortex a9 it is a perfect mobile by samsung in a budget of rs. 9000
this This is a very nice mobile and this is a perfect mobile for me as a music lover , white color mobile gives a nice rich look than blue or orange coloured mobile , wifi ,3g and gprs has a nice speed in surfing or downloading , No other samsung mobile gives nice audio experience than this mobile as it contains SRS Surround Sound, SoundAlive Solution , camera is very nice , audio through speaker is loud with clarity , battery backup is nice and better than y duos in this price range ,is is a good mobile for you if you are looking for: 1. good battery life (small display, speedy charging, use it very miserly and it lasts for 3 days) 2. good gps (feature include glonass, only set to have one in this range.)
Nice phone with excellent features available DUAL SIM,ICS(will upgred to jelly),BLUETOOTH TETHERING for share internet connection VIA bluetooth to other device like PC & Sound is really good and clear. Its keyboard turned in landscape mode & potrait mode also. battery backup is nice Its good phone for me & music lover ,
Not Good ,Compared To Price.Became Hang Every Time When I was using Temple Run... regularly Hang On 3G Network.... Dont Purchase It....
this mobile support's game but it is slow process... it is an waste product of samsung... this mobile couldnot supports high quality games... it is an use and throw phone...dont buy this mobile yours money is waste...
Have all the options as an android device. pic clarity n sound are not much good. but having all the options in the budget.. still a failure model too..
I have used for 6 months and exchanged with new one. Because of phone performance in opening contact list, phone hanging even after given mobile to samsung service also and no quality headset though it is a music duos.
I bought this handset 1 year back its smooth ...lags a bit but that's obvious with time.. Please buy a Memory Card too........will be useful If you can compromise on Screen Size buy it....It will be a surprise .....as with small size it is quite effective
i got this phone as gift from my dad 10 months back..... only one word for this phone WORST....... all i can say about this phone is its damn pathetic and its music key is annoying, gets pressed easily in bag and starts the music.... many times it made me ashamed during lectures.... n about the phone's performance.... its slower than a snail n weighs more than a bull.... tolerating it since 10 months so i will only say u please don't even give it a look.....
Looks good but it is very costly compare to its facilities... its 850 Mhz processor is not so fast...if u want spent 8000, then plz buy another item..not this..u will get lumia 520 also... I bought this samsung GT S6012 one year ago..and I am totally disappointed
phone has lot of hanging problem i suggest you to pls dont bye this this phone music quality is very good
i purchased it @ around 6k...and in 6k it's awesome phone...performs welll.....no lags....hangs a few time....still performing very well
flipkart service is very good. Phone is also nice and has everything what you except it do as i have purchase for only Rs. 5000. its only shortcoming is screen size.
I am using it from the last 4 months. Its quite satisfying except the camera. The image quality is not as good as what it should be. Otherwise its totally value for money.
This phone is OK. If you want a decent phone which can run some apps and not lag then this is not for you. Sometimes I've to wait for upto 30 secs before a number gets dialled, after I've "pressed" the required options. I'd not recommend this phone. As a rule I won't buy any smartphone below Rs.15,000 from now on.
Its the best phone in this range, as because other phones at this range have upgraded to Jelly Bean but they also have got the same sized screen of 3''. you can't exploit much of JB if you've got a small screen and less RAM. Its been a long time since I'm using this phone and I've faced a long list of problems, such as: 1. Display is poor. 2. RAM is less. 3. You can't move apps to your memory card.(BY ANY MEANS) 4. Its not for development purposes, so don't try to explore it using SuperUser permissions, it will really get slow. 5. Camera is fine if it is daylight and is bright around, but in a dark room or at night.... Just forget it. These are however the top 5 problems, however it has many other small glitches and lags. It also has some good features but in this generation, it is a flop show.
nothing is good in this phone. songs & videos brake many a time. games like temple run can not be run smoothly. it is very slow. this is the worst phone i have ever seen
Now this is one phone that not many talked about. In fact I am a phone geek and I missed this one too. I gifted my Dad this one. It looks a basic one, but packs in ALL the tech specs a high end phone has....trust me, this phone rocks all round. The display's kinda let down, but c'mon again, you really weren't expecting a Full HD AMOLED at this cost were you??? Great one Samsung!
I am using this phone for the past 1 year. This is quite low priced. But the phone is extremely slow to function, sometime hangs even when you try to call some one. The annoying part is the music button at the side of the phone which you cannot disable! So once in a while it gets pressed and music starts. The other big drawback is that sometimes it cannot receive the call even if the caller can hear that the phone is dialing! And you don't get a missed call alert after that. I think the problem with the phone is that Samsung has thrown too much apps and facilities in here! You get all the apps and features that you get in any high end Samsung phone. The hardware of the phone is not good enough to support that. On a positive note the screen is touch sensitive and you get all the features you get in expensive galaxy phones.
i was very happy when i saw dis product on flipkart bcoz it comprises all the features dat a galaxy y duos hve...rather of the screen size which is 3"..when i had got it on my hands..after only 3 days of order..i m glad cause it looks awesome nd have a gr8 look...i m using it for abt 7 months..bt i found no any fault..nd no any hanging problem...thankyou flipkart for providing such an awesome product to me.on such a reasonable price..i m very happy...must try
Phone which i have received is not working properly, in this phone some time ring or any indication not shows when any body calls this is for all incoming calls. I came to know this problem in September till then i have submitted to Samsung service center twice but they are not accepting that there is problem in hand set
Jai Mata Di! Greetings to all my review readers! Good points! Phone looks cool! Charges fast! Has widgets which was kinda new to me! Very helpful feature! Gmail connects very fast! unbelievable! Great Music features as the name stands for Samsung Music Duos like Speed control n amazing 15 effects which u can put ur song through like Cafe, Concert Hall n SRS Surround to name a few! Uncool Points Camera is not that cool! i can just not send MultiMedia messages from this piece but certainly that message from other mobile. tried a lot but Oh! its frustrating! Initially i thought it was the cell service but then i figured it must be handset issue! On the all i would give 3 to 4/5 depending on preference. If Music n Widgets n Online surfing like Gmail is concerned i would give 4/5. If Camera n Multimedia messages is concerned it is 2/5. Avg 3/5 Thanks for reading Frehn
As everyone say so many problems just occur. But the reason is bad software. According to all Samsung mobiles, it is awesome when you update it to 4.1.2 and root it. It is fine. Always follow xda developers for procedures. The only disadvantage is the outer silver coating gets peeled off. Other than that this mobile is worth buying for this price.. Actually the music button(which others mention as a mess) will be very much useful for changing songs instantly. It is a pucca MUSIC mobile. If you want a little more performance wise, go for Galaxy Young which is slight a good performer than this mobile. But Speaker rocks in Galaxy Music of all of this range.... :)
No regrets buying it..... A nice phone - good features and it was a very good price. Thanx FlipKart. Overall a very good deal.
One of the worst mobile coming from Samsung. camera, screen, look, body, processor, touch, performance, and many ......
good sound quality. i feel problem while using qwerty due to 3' screen size. ideal screen size for using qwerty is 3.3 . the music button provided is very irritating as it stays on after locking the device. means the phone will suddenly start playing music in ur pocket.
Its the best mobile with all new feature. I hav upgraded it from 4.0.2 (ICS) to 4.1.2(JELLY BEAN). Only feature it didn't hav is we cant connect pen drive using otg cable. Rest all features are really good.
Hello everybody i m using this phone for the past 6 months. This is the worst mobile which i ever used in my life. This mobile is not even worth a penny. I am giving 1 star because of flipkart service.
i swear though given with android 4.01 ,the hardware is not given with compatibility to meet the requirement of the software .this makes the phone to struck always .we cant even platy the damn hot temple run in it properly.its only just a big flop shit...............
Good delivery from Flipkart. The phone is also good for regular use. The screen resolution may not be that good but is okay when considered at this price!
Good product compared with the price you get android in 5 to 6 thousand so its delivering what must. Value for money product
Awesome phone.really satisfied with this phone Everything in a small phone. Dual Sim GSM 3G, GPS, Wi-Fi,Hotspot,Bluetooth,Android, 4.0 Camera 3.0MP, Good Battery Life, Best Audio and Video Skype ,whatsapp .Banking apps Only compromise with screen size.
- 2-3 days battry back up on wi-fi.... not on wi-fi gave me 7 days back up... - As the name suggest very clear sound - good GPS (feature include glonass, only set to have one in this range.) - doesn't hang.. but sometimes lag - Music button irretates sometimes. - Average camera (in this price range atleast this should be good) -- overall Decent phone for first users, otherwise might be a little bit expensive well samsung is asking a lot for its brand value
works fine, excellent mobile for the best price, luv flipkart xolo a500s also good specs very nice, impressed by flipkart delivery
Hi, really satisfied with this phone and also the specification i got this phone for 5000 in flipkart only after that i cant see any offer on this .. the camera quality is bit low but the working speed is good and the touch is good. If you are a music lover then definitely you will fall in love with this phone.
This is the most horrible phone. No doubt , it has got stylish looks but it has got so many bugs. Don't go for this phone. Don't waste your valuable money on this useless phone.
The mobile looks stylish and the blue color is nice to see. I find one issue in this mobile. The music player gets on most of the time accidentally. Other than that every thing is fine.
Well, you all know the specs: Screen is a bit shabby but other than that the phone is genuinely nice. Camera is good as long as you take pics outdoor. Music quality is impressive, battery life is good too, every normal and regular app works. I dont know who said that whatsapp doesnt work on this one. I assure you it does. Games are working normal, subway surfer etc. I was skeptical about the looks and color but trust me its nice. Inbuilt apps are decent as well. And as usual flipkart rocked the delivery, Impressed as always. Regards, Gaurav Thakur
Have order this as an gift to my sister. But while checking it found that music quality when played through media player drops intermittently. Also found the same issue as complained by others. Samsung galaxy series phones priced
I brought it in dec 12 since than facing problem. Actually some times it takes more than a min to open contact list OR dialing. I m having two sim and it doesn't show half of numbers from second sim. while when i put that sim on another mobile i got all the numbers. I got it formatted three times but it is not repairable. Music is ok. Purchasing of this set is totally wastage of money. As per my views there should be no Rating for this set but it is a compulsion.
The product design is sturdy. The sound quality is clear and easy touch options. It is designed specially for music lovers. Not available in other local markets Grab the off and avail it. It is worth buying it. AS only limited stock are there please be careful in choosing and compare with your budget weather it suits.
Good phone for this range camera is very nice, 3 MP is ok Dual-Sim-But call in one sim will switch off the other Battery back is bit low One Problem is that it hangs up some times(on high gaming). Now a days the device becomes stuck for some times. and i have to remove the battery for restarting the device. otherwise it will not respond.
Awesome SmartPhone on this price range..... Battery life is good it support each and every this of basic need music is so good but one thing music button is little bit annoying. it supported temple run, temple run 2, subway surfer through apk, csr racing
Flipkart.com team is doing a very good service they give me this phone on time it is a best android and music phone subway surfers is not supported but it has a stereo phonic speakers in front best suitable to view you tube videos
This is a very nice mobile and this is a perfect mobile for me as a music lover , white color mobile gives a nice rich look than blue or orange coloured mobile , wifi ,3g and gprs has a nice speed in surfing or downloading , No other samsung mobile gives nice audio experience than this mobile as it contains SRS Surround Sound, SoundAlive Solution , camera is very nice , audio through speaker is loud with clarity , battery backup is nice and better than y duos in this price range , Touch is very nice and it supports temple run game , The only negative is its screen it is 3.0 inches and 320*240 pixels .
It has everything in it a good music phone, nice look, its works very fine i have purchased it from flipkart for rs 4800. Its has many features. Only problem is when u use camera its a bit low in brightness in comparision too nokia phones. All n all a good phone at this price
I am using this handset from last week and it's working very well. I love Skype video chat app, only one problem with this handset it has no secondary camera so, you can see other on Skype but other can't see you.
Hi... One and only problem with is mobile is that it hangs up always and the phone is very very slow... I am very much disappointed and unhappy... Music is awesome but can't use with such hanging problem .... i don't recommend to purchase...
I would like to summarize it in 2 words :"Raddi dabba". The battery goes down in 4-5 calls. The phone gets heated up like hell all without any reason and without any usage. Disliking samsung at the moment for creating sub-standard phones. A chinese handset would've been better! All good features at this price attracts, but please do not befool people by creating such a bad mobile phone!
great expierience in 5000rs with ice cream sandwich but display resolution and camera is low qualitycompare other phone in this type of category 1. phone doesnt hangs, but some time lags(common in this range) 2. price is really good as far competitors are concern cheapest in all (sony tipo , htc desire c) 3 . It had Gps with Glonass ( no company one has given in this range phones) 4. camera is good has touch focus 5. best thing abt this phone is its dual stand by but when acts as active like if u r on sim one and u got a call on 2nd it wont tell the caller than its out of reach instead it will tranfer/divert to active one.. 6. Sound is really good and clear. 7 Sar value is very less .79 w/kg as competitors have more than 1w/kg 8 it does not have ambient light sensor and gyroscope(tilting wont work). 9. keyboard cannont be turned in landscape mode. only potrait..
This is a nice phone under this range which gives android 4.0 . The mobile looks cool with 2 speakers on mobile . White color is awesome. The main problem is the external music key . It sometimes got pressed even if it is in pocket and music starts . Anyways i gifted it to my mother so for her use , its best phone . Anyways now you can find more better mobiles in this range .
It was working fine for sometime but one fine evening while listening to music from this product i found out that the phone is going haywire. I restarted the phone and it resumed its normal functioning. However, later on, I found out that the processor is getting a little slow. But I ain't complaining, after all it's a budget phone. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Advantage---- I know that you will get the advantage from many sites.. Disadvantage-----1.>Temple run stop after 3 minute sometimes in my case but it is fine .. 2.>I didn't got any bug/issue till now...I am using this from last 15 days..
Looks Good,a budget phone with Android 4.0.4 ICS & great internal memory Easy to use Good battery life,Dedicated Cortex Processor for fast video play Good Touch screen Wireless FM,Stereo Speakers with loud sound.. value phone under rs.6000 in smartphone category.
I am using this mobile from past 2 months and I must say that it is truly a gem. Don't believe in negative reviews and comments, first use it and then tell. I'll list the pros and cons now: Pros: 1. Dedicated Cortex Processor for fast video play, never hangs and subtitle supported 2. Motion Sensor, shake compatible 3. Very responsive touch 4. Very good internal memory 2 GB is more for this price range 5. Supports many apps on Google play. 6. Promised Jellybean update 7. Wireless Radio (A very rare feature) Cons: 1. Slow dialpad 2. After you reject a call, the phone will slow if you immediately try to call again 3. Sometimes network gets lost, you need to restart the phone Tips: Replace all apps with the best ones from Google Play store, for SMS (Chomp SMS), Call (Dialer One), Mail(K9) etc. Use Nova Launcher, your phone can then beat any higher range phones. Whatsapp, Wechat, Opera Mini etc. all work super duper fine in it. If you want a budget phone with Android 4.0.4 ICS & great internal memory and superfine video play, simply close your eyes and go for it.
Budget Phone From Samsung nd flipkart. Nic phone, style, sound...............................................etc.., totaly supb.. and also good phn then other phns.............................................
it has been only 2 mnths since i bought this phone, it has come with some manufacturing software level issues which need me in line for more than 2-3 hours at the pathetic service centres of samsung(as big as their sales shops may look in malls, the service centre is no bigger than a 10*20 room, including the repairing section, imagine how inconvenient). also it is very very slow as compared to its compatriots like galaxy ACE (and it is not because i dont use it properly, i am a CS graduate, i knw the insides of it) also the screen touch is not so responsive as other phones.
nice phone......all the features are working fine.......you can play temple run game also..... music quality is also nice.......camera is fine 3m.........so go for it..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Using this phone from last 3 months Phone Screen is very small. Phone hang bahut hota hai.... kyi baar call karo to lag-bhag 5 minute baad jaake call - dialing start hoti hai. Restart karne ke kuch der tak to ek dum smooth chalta hai and baad me hang hota rehta hai and lag hota hai. games auto pause hote hain. koi bhi application apen ap exit ho jati hai. keypad while u typing message on SMS , WHATSAPP , Facebook, apen aap hat jata hai. Applications beech me hi apne ap band ho jati hai. EXIT ho jati hain. bought this phone at rupess 9000 but now rrate 7000 ho gaya hai thats is very bad
few month back i purchased a Samsung GT- S6012. I couldn’t afford the luxury of doing R&D and leaving without phone for 1 day and had to get a phone within 30 min. Went to mobile shop - got into talks of the sales person and ended up with a pack of this handset. Now, first things first, the specs..... samsung galaxy music duos s6012 sounds good, ya- I also thought so. But the next day on-wards, what I felt was, the battery life was terrible. My generic use is 4 hours talk-time and browsing per day. and , this beauty needed twice charging a day. ’ Next, the phone hanged somewhat in between while searching contacts, or coming back to the home screen.... And I have to restart the thing again and again. And his restaring process takes around 2-3 minutes. This put me in embarassing situation several times. after only 10 days of use . I submitted it at service center. Now Samsung is not getting it replaced saying that the phone was submitted on 8th day (Samsung has 7 days replacement policy which is never communicated to the customer). Till today, my cell is at service center and their is no communication from their side. Just procrastinating... The price was 8500/- and now what I strongly feel, spending some 6-7K more, I could;ve got a Blackberry. Now, this is my first experience of Android and Samsung,I must say, I AM DISAPPOINTED. Overall not suggested. P.S: for the topping, there is no stylish accessories available for this one.... and NO screenguard.
I thought to buy this product mainly for internet usage.... it this good one for internet.. but m going to use it in laptop only by putting net card in mobile. please suggest me. If this is not better one means tell me which one wil be better for that
well in the price range of (6-7)k you get an android phone which is running on ics. As the name suggests it is a music phone so the clarity of music the phone offers is superb.if you want a camera phone you would be disappointed but if camera is not your preference then buying this phone becomes obvious
I brought a music S-6012 on jan-27-2013 from mobile shop of our area, I saw some review that the internal memory is 4 GB but originally its internal memory (my mobile) near about 2 GB. It does not have 4 GB internal memory. The music button provided is very irritating as it stays on after locking the device. Means the phone will suddenly start playing music in your pocket.
Purchased this mobile 15 days ago. Frankly i'm impressed. One function is better than the other. However the shortcut button for music player is extremely troublesome because it starts off even when pressed accidentally when the screen is locked !!! Also many tracks are not supported by the music player, therefore i need to be careful when i download songs. Please consider my review when u consider purchasing this model.
A good music phone..... i am using it from a month i am happy with it ... at this price its a good phone - 3g works good - battery ok but not that good as it is a small screen phone it needs less power so its ok - little over heat - nice radio wireless and nice sound output - dual sim and dual speakers - wifi direct works good - music button big problem but at the end nice phone and looks different from other galaxy phone
It's all functions are working well,If you are planning to buy it we can buy with full confidence ,it's GPS with Google Map is very good.It's dual speaker is very awesome,It's price is worth. Uc browser and firefox is working good on this phone. You should use MX player with this phone, it can play all format including flv,MPG.Although we can install vla player on this phone with it is not working well as it works on PC. It's price is less compare to other sites. FM radio is working well . Camera is also good you can get good quality picture in proper light.
just bought the mobile yesterday and really it's amazing. music system is as it's best all the functions are quite cool, battery back-up is wonderful and different functions in camera are really useful and are astonishing but the screen of it is quite small. other colors like blue and yellow are not looking good but white is a beauty. gaming experience is not enjoyable due to a small screen. this mobile worth to be buyed and have a potential to give a tough competion to other mobiles is a same range
no autofocus and no doccument viewer. ugly look.costly.no need to buy this mobile.screen is small . this is flop mobile at this price .no doccument viewer and autofocus as written above specification.please dont buy this ,galaxy duos lite is better than this mobile
good phone ,update the firmware so that the game should not pause,music is superb with the provided phone, battery backup is OK,but if u know how to handle a smart phone or multi tasking phone....... and believe me if u know to manage multi tasking phone,u will never more in this range, GO 4 IT
I purchased this for rupees 9000 :( . totally wast. very slow mobile. take long time to load contacts and call log. if you want to reject one incoming call and call back it take 2 minutes.................... A bad phone with nice configuration
I've ordered this on 22.3.13 & I got this on 1st April'13(excludes Holi & Good Friday). It is working fine till now. So, I'm satisfied by the product till now(4.10.13) except frequent call drop prblm. Also, in detailed specification of this product, you should mention that though it's internal memory is 4GB, yet the user usable memory is 2GB, rest 2GB is for OS & Back Up purpose. So, overall, at present I've found this product not up to the mark, bcoz it's sound quality is very good but with head ph, call is disconnected after every 5 mins & other headphone is not detected by the phone where as camera quality is not good, ok. After locking also one touch music button works which is very disturbing when I wear jeans. Anyway, thanks to Flipkart team for your product & service.
No rating. Body of this phone looks very weak. Poor resolution, poor quality of Camera though its 3 Mega pixels phone colour is also very bad. My advise buy Samsung Galaxy Y Duos, don't fall on price.
Guys i started using samsung galaxy music since a day..it was awesome phone with good looking,and the music lovers can buy this phone as it has a good clarity of voice...even its memory specifications are good..and the touch screen will be easy to operate even for people who never used touch interface ..and be careful with the music button as it starts playing even when the phone is locked if the button presses.. it has all the latest features like os..and we can update it to next version too...thank you flipkart for delivering the phone within 2 days..
good phone with nice features in just 6999,with android 4.O, memory expandable upto 32 gb and with wonderful sound. :D
It is a gr8 one in its range....It has gr8 sound quality. FM works widout the earphones. It is bundled with In-Ear type Earphones which have a gr8 sound quality. totally rockin! n it also has Ice-Cream Sandwich...it has a gud touch....if u wanna buy a fone of its range...go fr Samsung Galaxy Music Duos!!
i bought this phone a couple of months back.. all its features work perfectly.. the battery backup is great considering an android phone.. the screen resolution should have been a bit better or not considering the battery is more.. apart from that wonderful phone with trendy looks.. worth its cost.. go for it..
sound quality and live wallpapers ect are good but video quality is low but quite ok in this handset we get android 4.0.4 we can upgrade it to jelly bean it has dual sim also.....i have purchased 1 month ago till now there is no problem and it has 445 mb of ram it is very good...its sound quality much better than any other handset who want less than 10000 rupees android mobile just go for it............ok..
I WANT INFO THAT HOW WELL THIS PHONE PLAYS GAME AND FINALLY RESULTS HERE PLAY GAMES AT STUNNING FPS ANY GAME U CAN PAY ON DRIFT MANIA IS LAGGY COZ ITS OLD GAME AND WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY IN THIS ANDROID VERSION PROBLEM FOR ANY OLD GAME BUT TEMPLE RUN PLAYING BUTTERLY SMOOTHLY HATS OFF FOR ME 5 ON 5 JUST CLICK BUY BUTTON
Pros: Stereo loudspeakers, greatly useful when watching videos. Rich equalizer presets for music player like Sound Alive SRS and more. Android 4.0 (upgradable to Android 4.1). Supports Temple run (lagging though). Wireless FM Cons: Music breaks in between while playing. Not affordable for a music phone.(The latest update fixes this.) Music button at the side of the phone. It works like the volume button even when the mobile is locked, meaning you need to be very careful as sometimes music starts playing inside the pocket. As the screen size is small, notification bar is cluttered when using both sim (This is the only area I miss my Samsung galaxy ace the most.)
nice touch great looks but the music key on the side works even when the ob is locked I have used this phone, it works well.. Nice features have been given, Music clarity is good,, Video resolution supported by this phone is better than Galaxy y. One problem - ie.. The screen light blinks simultaneously whether it is locked. Look is also GOOD!!!!!!!
