The worst phone I have ever seen in my life! -The battery cannot last very long. -The phone keeps on hanging at certain times. -The touch is very slow and pathetic. -Wastage of money. -The front and back cameras are of very poor quality. And, please, if anyone of you are looking for a good phone, I recommend that you don't buy this phone!
Its ok but battery power is very bad, have to charge daily and gets drain very fast. ... . .
