Extremely responsive, great quality screen, decent battery life. It lasts about a day. Just the battery panel feels really flimsy, I'm always afraid of breaking it when I'm trying to open it. Unfortunately xolo has left this great machine on android 4.0.4, the xolo update does nothing. Even though some newer phones of this same model come with 4.1.2 and they really should have android 4.4 on it now. Overall, there's almost no phone which is big enough but not too big, has a great looking screen and specs and is so blazingly fast. Especially at this price range and it's an Indian company to boot! Great phone. Unfortunately was promised a black but the seller ran out of those in time for delivery. Got a different colour instead but they were good about it and called to give me a choice. Good seller as well.
