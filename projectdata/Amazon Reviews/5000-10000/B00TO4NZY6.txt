This was a gift to my father. I did not open this as wanted to gift it unopened. After 20 days I gave it to my dad. This is the first smartphone my dad will use. unfortunately i see very poor voice quality. since it is more than 10 days could not return this. Now need to check with Samsung as it is under warranty.
Though it has many features but it is just 45days since i have purchased this phone and it is creating problem. It hangs a lot. Camerq has stopped working.. It doesnt work after taking a single pic n then gets hanged. Waste of money
excellent product. good seller. working satisfactory. Requesting also arrange such type of disount on memory card or any other electronioc items thanks
It is really a good smart phone. But as compare to Asus zenfone 4 , lenovoa600 , motoe2 it is not good . the price is very high.
Nice phon at the view of the budget
Very nice product in 7000 only.
1gb ram processing nicely
Thank you, fantastic!
