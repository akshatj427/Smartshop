This phone literally rocks... Got it as a gift.. But it hangs sometimes when locked... and that irritates me a little. Every time have to remove the battery and reinsert it and restart the phone to make it work right
Sometimes GPS does not continue properly.browser does not work properly.Most of the times it has been hanged. ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
I purchased LG Optimus Hub E510 from a retailer at Calicut. When I shifted from 5K range Nokia, I thought basic features will remain same in higher models! ONLY TO GET DISILLUSIONED! This phone does not show tower notification, which was very helpful during tain journey at night, to locate the station. My first Clt-Ktym trip, after purchase, had put me in trouble. I am not able to record incoming calls, which was a button distant so far. I contacted the retailer and the local LG Service centre, they are not helpful. Battery is running down very fast too. The chatter in ring tone and poor audio quality joined is making me regret my decision to buy this model. There are other good features, but I am feeling let down.
Thik thak because of the 800 MHz ARMv6 processor... 1 Ghz could have made it "David" amongst Goliath in the Smart phone market Due the slow processor one can not enjoy all the apps to its fullest extent, firefox for android wont run in this phone
LG Optimus Hub is a fully loaded Android 2.3.4 phone with some pretty cool features. It has all the usual stuff - 800 MHz Processor, Adreno 200 Gfx, 3G, WiFi, GPS, Market etc. etc. The touch UI and interface is pretty clean, smooth, and responsive. Games play well and the accelerometer functioning is excellent. All other features work brilliantly. Other competing models in this price range are - Samsung Galaxy Ace (comes with Android 2.2 and has to be upgraded), HTC Wildfire S, Motorola Fire Xt and Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini ST15i. Pros (over competing models) - 1. Gorilla glass! Don't think any other model offers it in this price range. 2. Wifi Cast. This allows you to share files with other Wifi enabled mobiles without needing a Wifi hub, at amazing speeds. This is gonna replace bluetooth very soon. 3. 1500 mAh battery 4. Bluetooth v3 5. DivX and Xvid 6. 2 back covers Cons - 1. No LED flash. This is the biggest drawback!! It's an issue that will work against this model. Dunno why LG couldn't give it a flash. It's criminal! 2. No FF camera. 3. 3.6 Mbps HSDPA 4. Bulky 5. No pouch. (Samsung scores here all the time) Yet I will not refrain from giving it 5 stars. Moto Fire XT costs lesser but has some performance and heating issues. Apps hang up at times. The Galaxy Ace may be phased out soon, if the word on the street is to be believed. The Wildfire S was not on my list because of its 600MHz processor. I was also seriously considering the SE Xperia Mini ST15i. It is an awesome phone with fantastic features - 1GHz processor, Adreno 205, 16M colours, Bravia engine and HD! It beats the competition in terms of features and performance. But I chose the Optimus Hub for the larger screen size. If smaller screen is ok, then go for the Xperia Mini. The Optimus Hub is one of the latest LG models and has just been launched in Asia and Europe. So you will not find detailed reviews or English videos on it. All videos are in European languages. To sum up, the Optimus Hub has great UI and gives superb performance. Go for it!
I am writing in the middle of the night being frustrated with this product. I purchased this phone by saving my hard earned money and it resulted in testing my patience. During the most important calls of my life this phone used to get hanged and cant open any application or even call. This phone should be thrown in the dump But as a common man, i dont have much to choose. Tried for resale, cant even get half of its price. Guys check any other phone but please dont buy this if you value your earnings.
quality of device is good ,but battery problem in 3g network,in 2g, gives good backup of battery .overall is good. one more problem in internal memory is only 152 mb .this is the minus point of this phone LG OPTIMUS E510 .
wer u bought for 12500Pros (over competing models) - 1. Gorilla glass! Don't think any other model offers it in this price range. 2. Wifi Cast.

It's a very nice phone. The display is awesome + the divx support enhances the beauty of the videos. The processing is good (800 Mhz with 512 mb RAM) but it has a few cons too like no flash support, internal memory is low (160 mb) and hangs sometimes when it's fully loaded with applications. Overall this cell is amazing and i will give 4/5 to my LG Optimus Hub. and IT IS BETTER THAN GALAXY ACE!
well , M using it for 3 months...firstly...i would tell you the..pros..n cons of this PROS 1) It has CORNING GORILLA GLASS which is superb ...and..no other phone will offer you at this budget . So this is an exception. :D 2)Wi-FI cast , This is an true amazing thing . It is offred at quite high budget phones ...this allows you to share files with other Wifi enabled mobiles without needing a Wifi hub, at amazing speeds. 3)XVID - u kno it vry well , u can download premium quality vdeos of XVID for free. The code no. is given in d cell itself. :D 4)Bluetooth version 3 . 5) Awesome call quality . it neds..a special mention ...i have used..a couple of good smartphones but the call quality of this stands out . phenomenal 6) 2gb memory card included in box. 7) Camera - 5 MP 8) ANDORID - 2.3 , ITS UPGRADABLE TO ANDROID 4.0.04 ICS. I myself upgraded it to ice cream sandwich. 9) Has Adreno 200 GPU . Well games play easily . I played GTA 3 in this phone which i downloaded from google play . :D CONS 1) No LED flash . Well after.so many stunning features like gorilla glass u should not expect a flash too . 2)Camera is 5MP but not that good . The 5MP camera in my old iPhone is much better than that. 3)3.6 HSDPA . less that expected . But it's ok ...to use . you will be satisfied. 4) A bit bulky to carry around . Not a big problem . 5) some very good games don't play in this phone such as FIFA 11 6) Resolution is 320x480 . Much less than expected . Otherwise screen size and build quality is good . 7) In rare occasion it hangs up sometimes mainly when we do multitasking . 8) optimus UI is not that good . Better that TouchWiz! But HTC sense UI is better than the best! Conclusion , It has all d great features and etc etc ....if your budget is 12000 INR GO FOR THIS PHONE . ITS BEST . I BET YOU WILL LIKE IT .
I am using it from last 1 month.... I am surprised that this phone dose not get hange a single time, while i had loade data more thant 14 GB.... 56 android games... 15 themes... 296 mp3 songs... 19 pdf book any many more like browser, musical apps, navigator etc... it is much much better than SAMSUNG ACE..... if any one will Optimus series they will deffnitly not go with Galaxy... It's a simply Great...
Really, a nice phone having a smooth touchscreen while working,provides better oppturnity to play games with high processor and 512 RAM.I really liked it. Hope all the users using it enjoying it with their awesome external features
I am using it for last week and its amazing it has very cool camera, the touch is amazing & Android v2.3 OS makes it amazing a should buy. its good than htc wildfire s. Android v2.3 (Gingerbread) OS 5 MP Primary Camera 3.5-inch TFT LCD Capacitive Touchscreen 800 MHz ARMv6 Processor Wi-Fi Enabled FM Radio Expandable Storage Capacity of 32 GB
Nice display and very user friendly. Also the lots of apps provided with the phone. The mobile also has a descent look. The camera also has very good clarity. The videos has a HD quality. All in one a best smart phone to buy.
if you like good camera feature never buy lg phones. i brought 2 lg phones hub and lg me 350.camera is worst than china phones. always keep in mind 2 things when u are going to buy android 1.Internal memory(at least MB) 2.RAM(at least MB)
