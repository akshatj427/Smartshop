It is one of best Xperia phones with killer looks. If anyone has budget less than 15K, then he should definitely go for this phone.
This phone worked awesome for the first six months. But, it started irritating me thereafter. The touch-keypad had problems in one alignment line from top to bottom, near the right hand side of phone where the letter 'i' is there in qwerty. After six months, the problem shifted to greater width of touch-screen which I can clearly see on the Sony Diagnostics. Moreover, touch has started getti way insensitive, and it doesn't seem like phone works on 1GHz clock speed. :/ A sad buy. Haven't got the set serviced yet. But it's good that problem crept in warranty duration. Please go for better GPU's and RAM's you may get at a price lesser than that of J. Comparison with cheaper phones: Samsung S Duos, which you can buy for lesser price, has same specifications. Same RAM, phone memory, GPU, clock speed, processor type etc. But it has better performance that this for greater age. Pros: Battery life. Way, way good. Practically, double than that of Samsungs' and HTCs' for same rate. Camera. (Obviously, Sony has to deliver it.) Cons: Lags, irresponsiveness to the extent that you cannot write on a vertical screen, you have to rotate it everytime. Making it lite doesn't help.
