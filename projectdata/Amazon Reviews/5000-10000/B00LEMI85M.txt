Its a very good phone in this budget. very sleek, slim n light weight. plus small so easy to handle n operate with 1 hand also. I bought blue colour 1. its a little different than the image. its jus been a fortnight since i m using it but still very happy with the performance...
Gionee P2S mobile meets all requirments and camera is perfect
