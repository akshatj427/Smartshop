I bought this phone out of necessity.. and am literally ruing my decision.. It always says that Memory is low... I had to reduce the number of apps from 6 to just 1 .. i.e. Whatsapp.. and it still hangs..!! The First line of my Keyboard is malfunctioning.. The Charging slot had to be replaced .. twice.. and that too from an outsider.. since the Service Center said that it would take me over a week to get it analysed and repaired...!!! I bought this phone from a retailer.. on 28th September, 2013; and I have experienced all this in not even 4 months since I purchased it.... And I have to take out some more torturous months, before I buy a new one...
A good looking and economical in android mobiles.
