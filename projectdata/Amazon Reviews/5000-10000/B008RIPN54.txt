I have been using Neo L for 1.5 years now... a black peace is simply superb in look and other performance. camera quality is too good(my frnds r too fan of its camera...) music quality is sony standard... very good I have not a gamer but it is a good phone as its battery also last whole day in 2g network... all n all i will 4 out 5 star to this Sony Xperia Neo L
Nice phone, have been using it since last 2.5 years and no problem related to hardware. The camera is still awesome. Only drawback... low internal memory.
