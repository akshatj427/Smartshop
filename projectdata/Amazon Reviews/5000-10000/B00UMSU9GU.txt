It's an excellent mobile phone.Good looking stylish... features are vey good. good mobile phone by ZTE..Keep going.
Awsome phone I'll recommended it and thanks to amazon for giving us quality products in cheaper rates heads off to amazon
wrost service ever seen from any mobile manufacturer. I have ZTE X Quad, Its screen is broken , now I could not locate any service center in delhi ncr for it. Moreover when I call the service center they even not able to help me out to solve the matter. At the end they said screen is of 4200Rs. but my phone costs me 6000rs.Hell!! Phone was OK but after purchase service is hell....
Good
