I have used this phone and let me tell you this is a worst phone. Keep getting hanged. Not smooth experience. I know the price is low so we cant expect much from this device. But it should be at least usable. Don't waste your money on this. If you really looking in this range go for micromax android one.
Performance is good as of now but back panel plastic body looks cheap quality
Nice mobile budget phone and working properly.
Good working phone...worth cost
Its too hanging
Nice product.
the worst phone at this price .samsung is now cheating. the s duos has more good feature than s duos 3 . Dont buy this phone . better you buy moto E or nokia or Xolo ,spice. Buying this product means wasting your money. It has not a sensor and front camera is so bad gaming experice is also very bad. some of the are also not working properly.A buyed this product thinking that it has more features than s duos 2 but later i know it wastes my money.I think SAMSUNG COMPANY feel shame on itself that he has launched updated product of s duos 2 as the worst product
Nice mobile budget phone.

Its OK,But battery durability is very low
Average

Overall all performance are good but camera quality is so poor in comparison to s duos 2. As it was 5mp but photo quality is like 3.5 mp. Its battery breakup is also poor. ...
They delivered me after nearly a month. wastage of time to use Amazon.in. Seems they are not committed at all.
Nice
Not working properly
