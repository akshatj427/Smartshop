Xolo recently announced Xolo A1000S along with their latest flagship device 8X-1200. This is a dual sim phone,powered by a 1Ghz Dual-core MTK6572M Chipset, which is also seen in some other low end handsets like Maxx AXD21 (running Android Kitkat,256MB Ram),Huawei Ascend Y330-U01,Micromax A102 Canvas Doodle 3 (1.3Ghz MTK6572) ,Lava Xolo A500 Club(1.3Ghz MTK6572) etc. # Screen & Display - 5 inch display with a 480 x 854 resolution (FWVGA, PPI 196). No big surprise here as this is a budget device. Some other phones like Moto E offers a better resolution in this price range though. Only 2 point multi touch is supported. # Build Quality - A1000S is a well designed phone with good looks. It doesn't give you an impression of a cheap Chinese phone. # Operating System - Android Kitkat 4.4.2. Glad this isn't running Jellybean. Like every other Kitkat device with 1GB Ram on board, things are smooth most of the time # Processor and GPU - A1000s is powered by a 1Ghz Dual-core MTK6572M Chipset and Mali-400MP1 GPU clocked at 395 MHz. This combination is no power house, but it can do your day to day tasks without much issues ,most of the time. Dont expect it to be flashy like a quadcore or an octa core device. Performance-wise it lags behind other quadcore chipsets like MTK6589,MTK6582 etc seen on many other Xolo devices. It would have been nice if this had a quadcore mtk6582 instead of this dual core processor. # Ram - Xolo follows the route set by other devices like Unite2,Moto E,Lava Iris X etc by shipping 1GB of ram,which ensures good multitasking. # Audio Output ( Dual Speakers ) - This is one of the main highlights of the device. I think every device should come with dual speakers for a great multimedia experience. Even those priced around Rs 30000 doesn't give you dual speakers. These speakers are placed well apart on the back panel # Battery. - Even though on paper,this is not that big, since this only has a dual core processor, along with the newer Kitkat OS make it less power hungry. You can get through a day of average use. # Camera - Dual LED flash is a nice thing to have...but, this only has a fixed focus 5 MP rear camera. You can get decent photos in good lighting condition,though you can't focus on things you really want to focus as there is no 'Touch to Focus' functionality available. In video department,720P video recording is NOT supported. Front camera is a VGA one that supports operator video calling. Camera features include Scene detection & tuning,Face Recognition,Panorama,Geo tagging,Best shot,Smile shot and HDR. # Multimedia - Even though it can't record 720P videos,it can play them without issues. Use MxPlayer App to get a better video playing experience. # Sensors - Accelerometer,Ambient light sensor and Proximity sensor # Verdict So who is this device for? If you are looking for a decent, budget multimedia device with dual speakers,and good looks, this is a fine device to own. Dual speakers are a rarity in this price range. Since the chipset on board is not suitable for heavy HD gaming and all, heavy gamers should look else where. Xolo has plenty other good phones around 10K suitable for good gaming.For those who don't want much processing power would find this quite a good one to use. I would have liked this priced a little lower in 6K range,as the more powerful Unite2 is priced around Rs 6500.
