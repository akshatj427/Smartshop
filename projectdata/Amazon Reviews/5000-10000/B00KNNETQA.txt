I gifted this phone to my mom and my girlfreind and they both are suffring because of this phone. The mobile which I gave to my mom have a network problem and whenever i call my mom i hear a creeping sound always. And the phone which i gave to my girlfriend got charging issues. So friends plz do not think to purchase this mobile. Its a junk of Rs.3200/-
Its my Genuine review and advice.. Pls don't waste ur money ... It has only 100mb internal and u can't use more than 2apps... Y they gave jelly bean without having internal memory is my bug question. Suffered a lot ....
I purchased this fone to gift to my grand daughter. She told it has an excellent features.Operating the fone is very easy and interesting. No hanging even she downloaded 10+ apps. Camera is not bad.
the phone has good features for the price. call quality is decent. however the rear camera's performance is much below that claimed. The camera really disappointed me.
this is a good phone in cheap rate.
