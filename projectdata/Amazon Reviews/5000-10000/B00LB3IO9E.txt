Internal memory is very low and not able to move apps to SD card. When contacted HTC they tell 516 do not have facility to move apps to SD card. Audio is very low.Will not recommend to any.
I have purchased this phone last month. Phone is good. I didnt liked few things of things - camera is just 5mp and 2mp - phone is bit heavy - call volume is bit low Apart rest is good.I like it
It was unfortunate that I received the damaged handset and gifted the same to my relative on Diwali. Issue is not the money I paid , but I lost my image and prestige in my relatives eyes. Amazon Lost one of its key customer forever, bye bye Amazon................
IF UR PLANNING TO BUY A SMART PHONE YOU CAN GO FOR ANY OTHER MODEL. NOT THIS !! I AM FEELING BAD AFTER BUYING THIS PHONE. HTC DESIRE 516 has only one problem which is a major problem,you can't move apps from phone storage to sd card. How are we going to install mutiple apps,when you have only 1GB of storage. Its not an user friendly phone, camera is ok but sound quality is bad.
Never go for this phone.i have been using it for 3 months.it is a phone of cheap quality except the htc logo on its front and back.camera is 5 mp and is very very poor in quality.even my old nokia with 3 mp camera takes pics with more clarity when i compared both.low volume levels both in speaker and ear phone is the other drawback.u cant even hear a song while travelling in a bus.screen is average,not smooth and is not ease to handle.somehow battery back up is good and performance is also not bad.overall the phone is not up to the level.never expected this from htc.much disappointed with my htc desire 516
I strongly recommend plz don't buy this product, its only waste of money and price is so high of this phone.all features are same as Micromax. and 4gb is not internal its only 2 gb usable,Camera quality is superb bakwaas.HD mode is only for bakwaas ,its totally waste of money.i request to Amazone plz refund my money.its gambling yar .i would like to say the price of this phon will be not more than 8000.
I got it 2 weeks back, but it showing the internal memory only 2GB, other 2GB for os Iguess, we are not able to use that, we can use 2GB only for our installations. except this the phone is very good speed, touch also good. camera clarity also good in day time, flash light images are not much effective.
This phone is so good but i am not happy with its camera flash its creates problem in night mode and my friends says abuse words for this phone and they compare it to micromax and says that micromax is better than htc. I suggest my friends for buy htc 816 or 820 they dont belive my words. Please solve its flash releated problems....
the camera is not much good as sumsung in the night its quality is very poor So I recommend not to but his phone
Touch is very bad. Phone hangs a lot. Not worth of buying it.
Camera is not good as I think ..I prefer HTC due it's camera clarity but this phone doesn't meet my expectations.this phone is not worth of saying HTC BRAND ..
Its a good phone especially according to its price it has much more features than should be available. Only the in call volume is a bit low but it is manageable or else it is superb. The white back cover gives it a better look.
sucks big time. cant use sd card and in built memory is only 4GB which isnt enough. i regret buying this phone. If only i had know how much it sucks
Another over priced phone with inferior specs A phone that costs almost 10k has no HD screen - What a Joke!! Xiaomi Redmi 1S costs 6k & offers HD screen. Lenovo A6000, which costs 7k, not only has HD display but also offers 4G. Rest of the specs are generic so I wont get into the details of those. Asus Zenfone 5 offers 2GB of RAM for 8k. If anyone has extra money to squander please donate to charity than buying this. So I URGE anyone looking for a phone below 10k to consider other BETTER OPTIONS and never ever think to buy this GARBAGE(aka Desire 616).
This phone is a piece of junk. Don't even think of buying it. It is powered by an inferior snapdragon 200 quad core SOC which isn't even close to the new Chinese mediatek CPUs. You'd be better off buying the lenovo A6000 or a xiaomi. Even xolo has some marvellous phones under its hood. The 4 GB memory is rubbish when you are paying almost 10k. Guys please don't go by some of the positive reviews as ppl writing them are absolutely technically challenged.
phone quality is best but there are some things that should be improved 1. weight should be decreased 2. camera quality is poor
the main problem is the back keys are not working and camera clearity is not so good ,,,,night camera is worst,, not hearing sound in bus not upgradeable to v4.4 os mobile weight is more.... no battery backup
Except camera, other features are good. Camera is too sensitive to its position (how you hold it) while taking the shot...depending on its tilt the objects in the photos look shorter or longer than the original size. Similarly, even a slight movement of the object while taking the shot blurs the photo. I had earlier used the Samsung Galxy fit before this HTC phone and never had any such problems with its camera.
Every accessories works properly good interface processor works good. You can try it.
I am not satisfied with this product given by Amazon. The phone does not work properly. Amazon has cheated on me. The touch at the bottom icons are not good. The phone hangs there. I think Amazon has given me a defective piece. Very disappointed. I will not buy anything from this website now.
Sir I purchase HTC Dizer 516 Rs.9708/- but it is not work proper back tuck bottom. I discusse your customer care Mr. Majestic. My account details below. Sanjeet shrivastava State Bank of India A/c 30027919022 IfC SBIN0001851 RAJKOT
Do not recommend buying this... Why... 1. Camera quality is not good, even with 5mp 2. Very low internal memory 3. Touch response on device home button is horrendous 4. Audio output through Bluetooth is extremely low in par with normal Bluetooth output
Hi, Its a very good mobile as a reputed brand. Speed is good, an adequate internal memory to store your Apps. Display resolution is very good. Decent rear camera. Major Con : Audio quality is not like older HTC models. I dont know why HTC reduced the quality of audio. Hanging up when you install several Apps. I recommend this mobile though its bit costlier (Brand is Brand) :-)
No sound from speaker
Internal memory is less. Else it's a good mobile within this price.
Phone is just as expected...!!! I loved it. U know smthing ....one of it's own kind..it's amazing... But..... That phone flip cover is not of good quality. It doesn't fit it perfectly...quite upsetting...
lot of glitches, screen keeps flickering, videos don't play.
Shipping method is too good. Its almost equal to US shipping and we can track the package regularly. Pefect site for ordering a mobile and package was too good. The quality of product is gud and im happy.gud mobile
Screen brightness is very low..u can't see contents in direct sun light even in full brightness. Ear piece volume is low. Front camera is not so good...otherwise performance is good
Very less sound, can't hear any conversation without speaker phone, and even speaker phone sound is also very less. Display is not so good and HTC ui is also not good
Feels Good Choice loaded with requirements
Touch problem & camera not good quality.
the battery back up is really very poor.
TouchWiz not as effective as it was expected. It had couple of other default configuration issues. The Outdoor/Loud audio profile didn't worked as expected.
A very bad phone...very heavy.. Lags a lot more then expected..very bad camera..very bad touch response. ..overall a very bad o Phone....
SYSTEM (MACHINE) HANGS TOO FREQUENTLY.
there are few problems in this model. i bought and put tempered but its back, details button are very hard. camera is not that great. touch is so so...
Delivered in time. Phone works fine.
I like to purchace cloths /shocks/shorts/round neck tee shirt also house hold goods- on line by cash delivary system, please inform accordingly
In this price below 10k this phone is good there is some small problem but i think there is such problem in every phone.else very good to use.
The phone is really good.Satisfied
Phone is not like htc Fitures Back button is slow work Front camera is good It's not awesome but ok ok
HTC Desire 516 is good phone but battery backup is poor ,heavy in weight,look wise good but I don't recommend this phone to purchase.
If fullfilled. My expectations. It has all most all the features as required and wanted by me.. I love the camera quality as well
Its awesm to use such a branded mob at less price preety cooll buddy , pls dont buy this as it then will becom common to every one
At this price its not worth it. You will get much better option at this price Don't buy this if you are hardcore htc fan
Really Good phone I faced few problems in call quality .volume is lesser than normal..overall good phone battery life is also great n camera feel like awesome..
product is excellent,,, but some problem lies with the hardware the button used for back operation doesnt work properly...
Good Phone, Battery problem, Get empty after 2 hrs of game/Net, Back touch not work properly Overally Good Product.
Very good mobile. Very user friendly. Good sound and soft touch. I strongly recommend this mobile.
Worst camera quality. Too bulky,highly priced,outdated os,low internal memory and much more. Dnt buy u will regret
This is one of the best in smartphone,also amazon is quick delivery to before estimated delivery time , i like it
Within 2 months i got sm problm in its handfree jack..at present its in htc care centre for about 1 month
Mobile is working so cute.. only drawback is the Flash light is some what Dull compared to others.
Camera quality is poor
Please read carefully. It's long but worth it.Â  I'm a tech savvy student and was a huge fan of HTC until a few months ago. My first android was a HTC Wildfire. It turned from a good to a terrible phone in 6 months. I still loved HTC. I went ahead and bought it's flagship phone, the One X+. It had the best specs that time, 64 GB internal memory, beats audio, 1.7 Ghz quad core Nvidia processor (fastest that time). I was impressed by the phone. Lag free, didn't hang, everything was perfect Until one day when HTC made a public statement that the One X+ won't get any updates(the M7 was shortly launched before the announcement). So here I was, stuck on Android 4.2.1 when even budget phones had Kitkat. I still have the phone today and regret it. HTC and Nvidia played the blame game against each other and the end consumer suffered.Â  NEVER EVER go for HTC. All HTC phones suffer from Poor battery life (after a few months) , lack of software updates. I spend a huge sum buying this phone and this is what I get. Software support for even less than a year. Stuck on old software.Â  HTC is a careless company, never ever keeps its old phones updated, even flagships.Â  It's an honest opinion folks, never go for HTC ever. Even the budget Lumia series is better than Â all HTC phones.Â 
I have bought this phone exactly a month back through amazon.in and what ever i mentioned here below are my user experience with this phone. Major drawbacks 1. Very low internal memory, certainly not enough for the typical mobile users like myself. Remember you need to move your apps to SD card , as you face the insufficient memory / memory low issue with in 2 / 3 weeks. As well as with photos, videos etc. 2. Touch sense and Bottom bottoms (Back, recent Apps) - Touch is not the way HTC used to be, it feels like normal quality. some times the bottom buttons wont work. To make it work you need to press the lock button and unlock the phone again. 3. Primary Camera - one word pathetic ! 4. Call quality - ok but at some times its not so clear and very low voice reception. Loudspeaker produces bad quality sounds with noise. Cautious Advice: Do not keep your phone on your ear when the phone is plugged in charging. The call speaker above the HTC logo gives electric shock. As much possible use only ear phone, even when the phone is not plugged in charging. Minor issues (For you it may seems to be a major issue) 5. Android in this phone seems to be customized and not very intuitive. I find this interface not so cool like it was in my 2 years old HTC Desire V. 6. Battery backup - like most of the smartphones you need to charge frequently in a day. Things which works fine for me 7. WiFi reception seems to be good, saves my day ! 8. The look of the phone and panel is nice From my user experience, i can advise any one not to prefer this phone. As there are many vendors who sells better phones with much lesser price than this. If you prefer the one word "HTC" over the cons of this phone, then you will regret ! BTW i bought this phone in amazon lightning deals for 10600 INR now the regular price itself the same. It simply means i am fooled ! And the amazon delivery is spot on and phone is well packed too. Thanks to the seller BTW !
It's not working as per expectation..back button not working properly..disappointed..:(
I like the phone, screen quality is great but little bit disappointing by its camera.
good to use htc desire 516 because not any problem at the time. so it's fine for me.
Awesome product love the hd pictures best phone!!!Happy with amazon services.
The display is not so great... Except d display m camera everything was good
cheap n fully loaded... but fragile screen flickers once dropped...!!!
Its good nd easy to use i brought it for my father nd he z happy to use it
Amazon and Delivery: For the price offered it is a best buy. Amazon has the least price all over the online shopping market. Shipment was delivered as promised. Product: Good mobile with decent features. HTC is competing with the local players offering quality product with max. features. The price being offered is too low for a product like this. Cons: A bit bulky and heavy. Screen resolution is on a lower side. Battery backup is decent. But, again for the price being offered everything is accepted because comparatively no mobile is offering such features with a low price and the brand HTC (At this time, dont know about the future).
I have problem in my phone sensor.so pls send me service center address
amazon.in sevice is very good but htc 516 mobile is vvvvvvv bad phone.
Mobile is good but its delivered late respect to mention time......

Nyc phn
Awesome
Good Product
Very bad phone by HTC. Internal memory very low. Screen not bright. No auto focus in camera and results in blurred pics. Low volume. Will never recommend this phone. Not even for free
Best smart phone in its price bracket. Dual Sim works seamlessly well. Comfortable for one hand use, no lag even when we play high res games like asphalt 8. The only problem I find is the ear piece volume is low comparatively and it sometimes gets difficult for you to understand what the person on the other side is talking about. No problem in taking call indoors. Camera is ok not great, front camera is decent. Again for the price you pay, there are some hits and some misses. So if you need dual Sim capabilities, good screen size, a international brand phone and can manage the shortcomings of camera and ear piece volume then this is a easy pic.
Speaker volume is very low. The biggest drawback is you can not move apps to sd card.the back button response is very slow. Inbuilt memorry is 4gb but space available is only 1.5gb
keys dont work properly
Superb

So so
Great
I like it very much, but the flip cover supplied with it is of no use, there is no matching of white and black.
