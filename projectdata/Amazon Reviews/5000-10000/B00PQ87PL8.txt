I bought this phone from gaffar market,Karol bagh,delhi a week ago.First the looks of this phone are just awesum and its quit slim and light weighed.the display quality is also nice.the sound quality is just average(not happy).no hanging problem as its couped with 1 GB ram.the battery sucks.battery backup is not that gud but charges quickly.camera quality is just OK.front camera is just amazing.I had a very harassing problem with this phone.the phone used to switch off itself.this problem was not only in my phone bt in my uncle's phone too.we went to the service centre twice they changed so called software(they known better)but still the phone used to switch off (kind of reboot).then I myself thought the battery may be loose so I tightened it with a small folded paper.now its working fine(yet).besides this its an awesum phone at this price tag.just go for it bt do check that(so called switch off problem first).
I bought this phone 2months back.working fine.no problem at all.best part are- very stylish look .camera works fine in dark .quick phone charging. light weight. Ear phone volume is just ok .music quality is not good at all just average
Kikat android ,1gb ram without hanging 8mp can too good 2mp frpunt can good overall mobile in this price superb
hd recording not support, one sim 2g AND one 3g, .poor battrey backup, camera quality not good, handsfree sound not good and also phone sound not good, ear peice volume very slow
No probs with it used it over 4months
