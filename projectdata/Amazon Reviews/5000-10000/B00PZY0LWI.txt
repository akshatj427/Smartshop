This is the best one ,but where is its cover???? I need.....
cell phone is good.. but we don't get any type of cover n extra accessories in market or any where on online website..
This is very good smartphone in this range it does not hang a single time its gesture mode is nicely suited this phone. This phone's graphics,processor,camera,touch,and the clearity in this mobile is like that of 17000 mobile it is full HD and very nice speakers sound. But bad thing is that the flip or back cover of this phone is not available in the market . overall this phone is best in front of it Samsung and micromax is fail
maine yahi se lia hai..amazon se..bhayi mujhe to achha laga...halka sa garam hota hai shuru k kuchh din tab thora kam use kro..uske baad aisa set hua hai..koi problem nahi h...HD screen hai..quad core hai..1 gb ram hai..and ram b khali rehti hai 500 mb se jyada...to hang to hua e ni kabhi...battery b dheere dheere roz charge ho k set ho gyi hai...kul mila k meri taraf se to 5 mei se 4 number hain...
Although mobile has 1 gb ram & 1.3 Quad core processor still while connecting mobile with pc it become hang.
Only problem is that it heats up after an hour or two of constant use
This is a good set only battery performance to enhanced.
Phone not bad, but not d best of battery choice anyways
It's nice and efficient.
