MOBDBFCM5D2NGSZP,"Sony Xperia Neo L Glossy Black, 1 GB","<p> An extension of the Sony Xperia Neo series, the Xperia Neo L is a mid-range smartphone filled with multiple clever features. Like the Xperia Neos preceding it, the phone comes in a bar shape. The device is run on the sophisticated and futuristic <strong>Android v4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS </strong>and possesses a dynamic <strong>1 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor</strong>. A 512 MB RAM warrants its ability to smoothly run apps on the phone.</p> <p> The relatively large display is a <strong>4-inch TFT capacitive touchscreen</strong> and provides a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels. The scratch resistant screen provides a level of ruggedness to the device. The UI provided by Sony on the phone is Android&rsquo;s very own <strong>Timescape </strong>which incorporates a degree of simplicity for the user.</p> <p> There are two cameras on the Sony Xperia Neo L. The rear facing camera is a powerful <strong>5 megapixel </strong>device which is accompanied by an LED flash so as to click pictures under minimal lighting. The camera allows the user to <strong>record video in 720p HD</strong> at 30 fps and includes features such as Auto Focus, Touch Focus and Geo-tagging which combine to make the picture-clicking and video-recording experience very enjoyable. The front-facing 0.3 megapixel secondary camera allows the user to carry out video calling easily.</p> <p> <strong>Design</strong></p> <p> When designing this phone, the makers have paid close attention to aesthetics. This is seen in the phone&#39;s dimensions which are 61.1 x 121 x 12.2 mm. With a thickness of 12.2 mm, the device is extremely slender and comfortable to hold. Additionally, the phone weighs in at 131.5 g which makes it quite light in the hand. The Proximity sensor, which prevents the user from tapping unnecessary buttons when held close to the ear and the Ambient Light sensor, which changes the brightness of the display according to the surrounding environment, manage the display effectively.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Storage and Battery</strong></p> <p> The device comes with an internal memory of nominal 301 MB. However, it includes a 2 GB memory card within the device. The memory on the phone can be expanded to up to 32 GB using a micro SD card. The relatively high specifications of this device require an equally capable battery. Hence, the phone is powered by a 1460 mAh Li-Po battery which promises to provide up to <strong>7 hours of talktime</strong> on 2G or 3G networks.</p> <p> <strong>Connectivity and Features</strong></p> <p> The Sony Xperia Neo L is well equipped to keep you connected at home, work or on the move. It comes packed with <strong>GPRS and EDGE technology</strong> for data transfer over the 2G network. The device also comes with HSDPA and HSUPA technology for optimized data transfer over the 3G network. This <strong>Xperia Neo L is WiFi enabled</strong> to let you access the internet from a wireless network. The phone can be tethered to another device using the WiFi hotspot or through the micro USB port. This <strong>Sony Xperia Neo has GPS support </strong>in the form of A-GPS which enhances the ability to locate the user with the help of Google Maps. Files and documents may also be transferred using the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> functionality.</p> <p> The phone promises to keep you entertained with the help of the inbuilt music player. The music experience is further enhanced with xLOUD Audio technology which improves the audio quality of the device. If that doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the user&rsquo;s entertainment needs, the phone comes with a video player as well.</p> <p> Social networking on the Xperia Neo L becomes easier with the <strong>Facebook, Twitter and Skype </strong>apps that are bundled into the device. The business features on the phone include Document Viewer and Document Editor. These features allow the user to manage and edit office documents on the move. The Pushmail feature is for users who need to stay connected with their Email on the go.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p>","http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/s/z/p/sony-xperia-neo-l-400x400-imadbfdch94qxz6h.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/s/z/p/sony-xperia-neo-l-75x75-imadbfdch94qxz6h.jpeg,http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/s/z/p/sony-xperia-neo-l-275x275-imadbfdch94qxz6h.jpeg,http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/s/z/p/sony-xperia-neo-l-125x125-imadbfdch94qxz6h.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/s/z/p/sony-xperia-neo-l-40x40-imadbfdch94qxz6h.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/s/z/p/sony-xperia-neo-l-100x100-imadbfdch94qxz6h.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/s/z/p/sony-xperia-neo-l-200x200-imadbfdch94qxz6h.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/s/z/p/sony-xperia-neo-l-original-imadbfdch94qxz6h.jpeg","16990.0,INR",6979,http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/sony-xperia-neo-l/p/itme6g3fctmkn8jf?pid=MOBDBFCM5D2NGSZP,Mobiles & Accessories>Mobiles,Sony,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,"[{""title"":""""}]",0,"0.0,INR",,Glossy Black,,[MOBDBFCMZHRZJYHH],[MOBDBFCMZHRZJYHH],

MOBDBFCMZHRZJYHH,"Sony Xperia Neo L Glossy White, 1 GB","<p> An extension of the Sony Xperia Neo series, the Xperia Neo L is a mid-range smartphone filled with multiple clever features. Like the Xperia Neos preceding it, the phone comes in a bar shape. The device is run on the sophisticated and futuristic <strong>Android v4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS </strong>and possesses a dynamic <strong>1 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor</strong>. A 512 MB RAM warrants its ability to smoothly run apps on the phone.</p> <p> The relatively large display is a <strong>4-inch TFT capacitive touchscreen</strong> and provides a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels. The scratch resistant screen provides a level of ruggedness to the device. The UI provided by Sony on the phone is Android&rsquo;s very own <strong>Timescape </strong>which incorporates a degree of simplicity for the user.</p> <p> There are two cameras on the Sony Xperia Neo L. The rear facing camera is a powerful <strong>5 megapixel </strong>device which is accompanied by an LED flash so as to click pictures under minimal lighting. The camera allows the user to <strong>record video in 720p HD</strong> at 30 fps and includes features such as Auto Focus, Touch Focus and Geo-tagging which combine to make the picture-clicking and video-recording experience very enjoyable. The front-facing 0.3 megapixel secondary camera allows the user to carry out video calling easily.</p> <p> <strong>Design</strong></p> <p> When designing this phone, the makers have paid close attention to aesthetics. This is seen in the phone&#39;s dimensions which are 61.1 x 121 x 12.2 mm. With a thickness of 12.2 mm, the device is extremely slender and comfortable to hold. Additionally, the phone weighs in at 131.5 g which makes it quite light in the hand. The Proximity sensor, which prevents the user from tapping unnecessary buttons when held close to the ear and the Ambient Light sensor, which changes the brightness of the display according to the surrounding environment, manage the display effectively.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Storage and Battery</strong></p> <p> The device comes with an internal memory of nominal 301 MB. However, it includes a 2 GB memory card within the device. The memory on the phone can be expanded to up to 32 GB using a micro SD card. The relatively high specifications of this device require an equally capable battery. Hence, the phone is powered by a 1460 mAh Li-Po battery which promises to provide up to <strong>7 hours of talktime</strong> on 2G or 3G networks.</p> <p> <strong>Connectivity and Features</strong></p> <p> The Sony Xperia Neo L is well equipped to keep you connected at home, work or on the move. It comes packed with <strong>GPRS and EDGE technology</strong> for data transfer over the 2G network. The device also comes with HSDPA and HSUPA technology for optimized data transfer over the 3G network. This <strong>Xperia Neo L is WiFi enabled</strong> to let you access the internet from a wireless network. The phone can be tethered to another device using the WiFi hotspot or through the micro USB port. This <strong>Sony Xperia Neo has GPS support </strong>in the form of A-GPS which enhances the ability to locate the user with the help of Google Maps. Files and documents may also be transferred using the <strong>Bluetooth</strong> functionality.</p> <p> The phone promises to keep you entertained with the help of the inbuilt music player. The music experience is further enhanced with xLOUD Audio technology which improves the audio quality of the device. If that doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the user&rsquo;s entertainment needs, the phone comes with a video player as well.</p> <p> Social networking on the Xperia Neo L becomes easier with the <strong>Facebook, Twitter and Skype </strong>apps that are bundled into the device. The business features on the phone include Document Viewer and Document Editor. These features allow the user to manage and edit office documents on the move. The Pushmail feature is for users who need to stay connected with their Email on the go.</p> <p> &nbsp;</p>","http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/y/h/h/sony-xperia-neo-l-400x400-imadbfdcpyfdfumm.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/y/h/h/sony-xperia-neo-l-75x75-imadbfdcpyfdfumm.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/y/h/h/sony-xperia-neo-l-275x275-imadbfdcpyfdfumm.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/y/h/h/sony-xperia-neo-l-125x125-imadbfdcpyfdfumm.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/y/h/h/sony-xperia-neo-l-40x40-imadbfdcpyfdfumm.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/y/h/h/sony-xperia-neo-l-100x100-imadbfdcpyfdfumm.jpeg,http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/y/h/h/sony-xperia-neo-l-200x200-imadbfdcpyfdfumm.jpeg,http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/mobile/y/h/h/sony-xperia-neo-l-original-imadbfdcpyfdfumm.jpeg","14990.0,INR",9499,http://dl.flipkart.com/dl/sony-xperia-neo-l/p/itme6g3fctmkn8jf?pid=MOBDBFCMZHRZJYHH,Mobiles & Accessories>Mobiles,Sony,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,"[{""title"":""""}]",0,"0.0,INR",,Glossy White,,[MOBDBFCM5D2NGSZP],[MOBDBFCM5D2NGSZP],
