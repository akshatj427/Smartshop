Pros: Good battery life Large display Upgradeable OS (has Jelly bean installed already) Packaged with flip cover and scratch guard Good quality of headphone Call and speaker quality is good Cons: 512 MB RAM is too less. Most of the time it will show out of memory message, especially with the kind of pre-installed apps Screen resolution is not good Poor quality front-camera 5.5" Can be bulky for some Video display is not at all good
Best class in class n range ,good battery,good big screen ,better than samsung,because it never gets HANG..
It is OK for now. and i can give it 5 starts if it works fine for atleast five years without giving trouble.
