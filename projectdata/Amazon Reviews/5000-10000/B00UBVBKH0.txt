AWESOME mobile, very sleek, good memory,very good camera,long lasting battery(8 hrs with 3G internet), worth the money
I sent this phone as a gift to my niece. She loved this phone for its looks and performance within hours after receipt. I am satisfied that she is very happy with the phone. Hope the product lasts long enough.
nice phone for this budget good looking
It is one of the best phone in this low budget.. I am sorry for not declaring it perfect and also not rating it full just because of one drawback in it. It doesn't have light on Home Screen buttons. So during night it is not easy to operate as we only have to predict the buttons instead of looking and operating them directly.
Where is 8GB internal memory? I wish this set in my hand with Gorilla Glass Protection.
Nice handset at low budget. Great specifications at this price. Nice working
3 star for design and android lollipop not for performance overall product battery backup is also not good camera is good but data cable is awful for transferring data
Over all mobile is very good magar network btane me kamjor hai kripiya pahle se check krle fir kharide...camera pura bewkuf bnane wala hai..
