I bought this phone for my mom. My mother accidently dropped this in water and its still working fine, it even fell down on concrete a couple of times. Its pretty handy and has decent build quality. The design is neat and simple. Even if the camera is 2mp the quality is impressive and looks it was taken by something more than just 2mp, the front cam is average but the fact that a budget phone like this having a front cam is plaudable. I have been an android user but I must say I am pretty impressed by the Windows OS, I would totally recommend this for those who are looking to buy a backup phone or for gifting one for their parents.
A great phone for the price and has shown excellent battery life so far. The orange is matte orange and not glossy as the pictures seemed to indicate.I wanted the matte, so that isn't an issue. I bought it for my mom, in lieu of an Asha series phone that she was using. The touch is noticeably a lot better and I've experienced very little lag in the app experience even though they are installed on the SD card.
don,t buy Microsoft Lumia 435, battery backup very weak
Its just an awesome phone. Best for teenagers who loves design and colours. Excellent job Microsoft.
