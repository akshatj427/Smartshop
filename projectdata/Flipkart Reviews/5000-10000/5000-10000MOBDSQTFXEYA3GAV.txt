i ordered this one, for my friend, after using it for more than 5 months. here are the reviews. 1. VIDEOCON, MOST THINK, IT IS UNKNOWN, BUT I TELL U , OUR INDIAN PRODUCTS ARE GOOD IN QUALITY AND SUPPORT, BUT MANY OF US DONT PREFER, THAT IS OUR MISTAKE. 2. A55HD, SUPPORTS ALL FULL HD VIDEOS, AND IT IS SHARPNESS , AND DPI. MAKES YOU ATTRACTIVE DISPLAY, MOST EVEN SAMSUNG MISS OUT IN DPI., NOT HD MAKES GOOD IT SHOULD HAVE GOOD DPI. 3. BATTERY IS FINE, LIKE EVERY ANDROID SMARTPHONES., STAYS 5 DAYS IF YOU USE AS BASIC PHONE, BUT MESSENGER AND NET ON 24*7 YOU WILL LOSE 20% OF BATTERY. AND ALL APPS BEING USED DRAINS THE BATTERY. 4. ONE IMPORTANT, EVEN SAMSUNG SONY DONT PROVIDE YOU, IS THE AUDIO QUALITY AND AUDIO OUTPUT AND VOLUME, I TRIED ALMOST ALL MANUFACTURERS, SINCE I AM A MUSIC LOVER, YOU CANT MATCH VIDEOCON AUDIO OUTPUT THROUGH IN EARBUDS. 5. CAMERA IS EXCELLENT , IN DAY, AND SUFFICIENT LIGHT, LED FLASH WORKS GOOD AT NIGHT AT DECENT, BUT CANT BECOME A NIKON LIKE THAT. 6. FRONT CAM, IS 3.2MP, IS VERY GOOD, VIDEO CALLING IS FINE. BEST TO GO FOR A RELIABLE MANUFACTURER, GOOD SUPPORT, ETC., ESPECIALLY FOR AUDIO. NO SONY NO SAMSUNG, VOLUME WILL BE LIMITED IN THESE.
Very less internal memory, only 4 service centers in bangalore that too far away in 4 corners of bangalore. very cheap service. got it for 12,000k and to repair the touch screen it costs more than 6k. i can go for better mobile than this product for 6k. very cheap
its a very heavy set with very less battery back up. service centre only 7 in delhi that too far away.avoid at all cost even at 7000.rating i m giving one because no lower option is there
