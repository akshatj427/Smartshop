Great phone,full value for its price. Using it with one SIM currently - fully satisfied with what it does. The one missing star is for the fact that it 'hangs' sometimes (rarely)...for the briefest of moments and then comes back to 'normal' operation without requiring me to do anything. But that has not been a deal breaker this far.
this mobile meets my requirements.i was using 1gh processor earlier at the same price band.that was irritating.its dual core is far better than that.looks are pretty good.very good peerformance.i have no complaint so far.i love it.....thanks
i bought lg optimus from amazon and it is nice and had all features...camera is nice processor is well and charging is also good....i think socho jara hatke lg apnao.....:) as it is different from samsung and other mobiles
UI is really good, I think way better than Samsung's Androids. Wish LG should have included a brightness sensor too for saving battery a little bit more
Thanks to the very positive and quick response by Amazon. Also a very good mobile. I am quite happy. Nice.
