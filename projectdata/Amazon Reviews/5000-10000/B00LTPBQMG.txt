i hate this phone bicose this phone has too high price and flop seces i did no why? but i hate oppo
Got a great OS, Excelllent features including really awesome and robust gesture support, But very very slow. Very disappointed becuse of it. Not worth because Androids if not responsive are irritating.
Performance is not as expected. It lags.
This is really value for money, oppo smartphone is the best than any other brand
