Optimus L5 II E450 is budget android device from LG. This was released in early 2013,hence the specs are on the low side comparing to the specs we have today for the same price. Features 1) Single core 1 GHz Cortex-A9 Mediatek MT6575 Processor - Other devices at this price range comes with quadcore processors. 2) 512 MB of ram only which is disappointing. 3) Battery backup is not good.With a 1700 mAh battery,you can hardly get a full day of moderate use with internet on. 4) Android Jellybean 4.1 - outdated.This is not even running Android 4.2 5) Average 5MP rear camera and NO front facing camera for video calls. Overall a good branded budget device,but only suitable for basic apps use. This cant handle gaming and graphic intense apps well. You can get better performing devices like Xolo Q700,Xolo Q1000 Opus etc for this price today.
very good set
I ordered it on saturday and got it at monday 9 am. charged it for around 6 hours for first time. Using it with net connection all the day n no need to search for charger. Battery assures u completely one day (1700 mAh). Best phone for money. No hangs n lags. loads all apps easily. Dnt hesitate jus go for it if u lov to use a single sim phone.
