Sound quality is poor when increasing the volume of the media files and auto rotate is not working properly
Good Choice for customers looking for GSM+CDMA under 10k. Good configurations and specs.! Worth buying.... :)
The smart phone is very good as for as the DATA usage in CDMA is concerned. However, the call volume is very low in spite of setting it at highest level and is not clearly audible if there is some noise in the surrounding area. Hence, it will be very difficult to use it outdoor without hands free.
Nice Phone...in this price range. Best feature is that ...it supports GSM+CDMA . if you are looking for A budget GSM+CDMA phone, this can be a best choice :)
Photos and video clarity is good, best smart phone in 10k with CDMA.
Good phone. Good performance. Audio quality should be improved.
it is excellent device for cdma users with evdo
Good phone for CDMA customer
