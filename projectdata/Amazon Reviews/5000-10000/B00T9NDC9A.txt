Awesome product. Apps are very user friendly. The only drawback is that the back cover is very ridiculous to open, and one have to be careful in doing so, otherwise it might got broken.
i received it on time. and till now its working fine.......
yes it`s a best mobile phone with this range.especially speed processing,looks,camera &operating system 8.1.I love it.
