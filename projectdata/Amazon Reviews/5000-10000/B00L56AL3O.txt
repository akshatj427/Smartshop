i have been using the phone four past one and half year.. so, i would say this is the best phone for this money, even now. pros: good design excellent camera value for money good gesture features available cons: idea service: not available everywhere 512 mb ram: hangs a lot. difficult to get cases and other related items battery: isnt that good. will stand more than a day if used carefully
