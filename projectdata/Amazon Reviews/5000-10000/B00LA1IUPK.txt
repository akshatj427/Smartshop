it was upto the mark in the budget section. so far no problems with the handset, battery backup is good, touch function are good and and speed is also what is expected. what can be defined as satisfied. amazon delivery system is quick and fast,best in the Indian market. 5/5 for the system. it never let me down.
Excellent phone with all the features thar are mentioned are there . Its is a basic phone so don't compare it with any advance one. Camera is ok ok, voice quality is good , touch is good battery back up is good. Amazon has done brilliant job to deliver in one day.
The build quality of this phone feels superb and a screen guard is already applied to the phone. We also get a case with the phone. The head phones have a flat cable and the phone is working well. No lag. Overall a good buy for Rs 4000/- The UI is very old stock adroid which was introduced with android 4.1 Jelly Bean. But as this is a Kitkat phone I would recommend to use Google Now Launcher. Amazon did a great job with the delivery, was expected after a week after ordering but got it within 24 hours without even paying extra 99/- for One day Delivery.
Good product best price excellent price
This phone is worth every penny. The touch is smooth and screen size is also OK. Within this price range, this probably the best phone. And much satisfied with the service from Amazon.
