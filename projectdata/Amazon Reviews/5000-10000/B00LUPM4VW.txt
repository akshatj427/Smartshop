Overall is fine with whatever we can expect from a smartphone of this price range, however battery seems a bit problematic for this set.Now it is showing 98% and after 20 minutes only, it get switched off because the battery is exhausted!!!But I don't think that it's the problem with the brand, it's the problem with that particular battery set, as I bought another one from amazon (diffrent seller) and that battery is performing as expected.Picture quality is little lesser compared the specified megapixel.
Performance is awesome..But the mobile color is different its deep green but still looks classic. Super slim.
Cheep & Best I love it. Amazing phone. Everybody in my family liked it.
i am really satisfied with the product thanks to amazon for 1 day delivery and the phone is awesome and love it it is much more what i expected
The battery charge is the main problem. otherwise it a very smart phone at this price.
Xolo is a budget smart phone
It s. Osam phone
