camera is not upto mark otherwise service of amazon is good packing is good and delvery is on time good to buy again from amazon
It is a good & nice looking phone in this low budget but it needs more internal storage space. It's main drawback is it's battery. The 1400 mAh battery is worst for a smart phone when we using internet. Battery drains very quickly & it needs charge 3 to 4 times in a day.
Overall it is good. Camera is poor. Touch quality is just fair. But we can expect only this much for this price. But the build and look is excellent. Dual speaker idea is good.
Data cable not work proper manner. Please replace it.
