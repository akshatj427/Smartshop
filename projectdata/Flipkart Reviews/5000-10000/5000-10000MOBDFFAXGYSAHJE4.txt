I feel the specs of this phone is worth the 7K price, and I don't find another 3g phone, with front cam , four inch screen, 2000mach battery etc etc... Any body found cons for this except that it doesn't have led flash... but other mobiles in this price may have led but no 3g or if 3g is there no front cam etc etc... would like to hear from someone before booking this mobile :)
