No the product dint meet my expectation at all.. i had ordered for canvas lite but was shipped canvas unite.....!!!!!
Don't every buy a micromax mobile because they use very cheap products and can break down any time. Earlier I was using HTC Desire SV which was the best but I lost it. The UI is very uncomfortable and processor is slow. Its common sense that HTC and Samsung are making same config mobiles for more than Rs 20,000 but Micromax is making it for less than INR 10,000. They are using cheap and defective parts
