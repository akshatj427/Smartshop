"The processor is kind of basic and the OS is little outdated as many other mobile companies are offering better OS and processor for the similar price." says product description which is very true. This thing is suitable only for basic usage.Since this is priced higher than many good quadcore+1GB Ram devices,this is not worth buying. Those who are buying for the CDMA support in this device,let me tell you,this only supports MTS sim.
Product quality & performance very poor. Colour of photos are awefully bad and dull
so far so good
