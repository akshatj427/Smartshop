Ok, the wait is over and product is in hand. Have been using it from past 4 days, Ordered it a pre-order and to my surprise received it in 3 days (Thanks to flipkart and WS Retail). * Android Version= 4.2.2 (very good) * Display= Very good * Looks and feel= Classy, sleek, handy with right size and weight * Battery= Not very good but acceptable ( 1 day for an average usage) * Camera= Good pictures for the price point ( for regular photos it is very decent) * Sound Quality= Excellent * Mic Quality= Excellent (i am mentioning this because with my previous phone i had to repeat my words loudly for the other person to understand, now when i talk to people they say that the sound is extremely clear even when i speak very softly) * Process speed= Decent * Memory= Internal 4 gb ( around 2 gb free to download apps), this android version does not support moving apps to SD card, ok for average users but i would prefer with this option without rooting * Sony apps= Excellent * Dual Sim= While on call on one sim, the other sim goes to stand by. While using data on one sim, both sims are active. It is a very good phone at this price point (compared to android phones), looks and sound clarity are its USP.
Sony name is enough for quality of product. Xperia M dual proves its "Sony" in all department except its camera. Camera is not upto the mark. Another factor is you cant install application on SD Card. This is bad part of this mobile and sony provide only 4 gigs memory out of only 2 gigs is available for end user Pros : Android 4.2.2 (preinstalled on device) Nice design and UI Good 4" screen Sony music quality Battery life is good (1 day) Good wifi reception Dual Micro Sim Cons : 5 mp camera not produce good result Only 2GB Internal memory for end user Memory expansion slot is useful for media only not application and games
i had been waiting for m dua since single sim xm was launched in june. i had pre ordered on flipkart as soon as it got listed but got this mobile in local market on 2nd October .. so just couldn't wait n cancelled the order on flipkart and bought at same price in local market. now review. 1)display-10/10 2)battery-8/10 (Moderate User like 3g on for all time 1-2hr wifi 1-2hr gaming 1-2hr music it will last full day till u reach home) 3) hardware -10/10 (dual core krait + 1gb ram makes it lag free device) 5) connectivity- 10/10 (as it has all connectivity options plus NFC which is not found in this range) 6) size-10/10 (4" size makes it handy is easy to carrry and it resembles to Iphone5) 7) camera-7/10 ( 5mp camera not upto the mark) over all good device at this price range.. strongly recommended for dual sim users
As usual your service is good flipkart but,I am very sorry flipkart to mention this ,i ordered Sony Xperia M Dual (Purple) (OD40411062752.). according to this link http://www.sony.co.in/section/shop we should get sony products only from WS retail at flipkart not from DEKOIT or anyother, if we buy so its out of warranty.flipkart didn't even mentioned about warranty. so please mention clearly hereafter for any product
Please be ready with Micro SIM because this handset supports only Micro SIMs. on a scale of 10 Super Sexy n Slim Handset (10/10) Display and touch response is brilliant (10/10) Sound clarity is good. Bass Boost option is there for bass lovers & lot of other sound enhancement. Loudness is bit less may be Sony is not giving it purposely (7/10) This handset is packed with 1 GHz Dual Core processor. This is not at all disappoint game lovers (10/10) Camera quality is not that impressive as per my expectation (5/10) Overall...very good handset with all required specs Jelly Bean OS, 4 inc screen, Dual Sim, Front & Back Camera, 1GHZ Dual core processor, 1 GB RAM & 245 ppi. What else we want from a premium brand at this price.
very bad service i got a damaged piece nd i have placed a return request also these guys r nt evn responding nd taking back my phn .. flip kart suckssss
Firstly, about the service..it was delivered in just over 2 days which is great..was properly packed. Good service by flipkart! Secondly, about the phone! Its a great one..beautifully fits into the hands, wonderful looks. I would suggest you put a back-cover before using because the rubbery back takes some hand impressions and its hard to remove it! Battery seems pretty decent, no lag at all, good features, comes with android 4.2.2..what more do you want from 13.4k phone? (though i got it for 11.4k because of cashback scheme ;) ) Only disappointment is the camera..it could definitely have been better! AND AND..FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE COMPLAINING THAT THE CAMERA TAKES IMAGES WITH BLUE TINGE IN IT..THERE IS A 'BLUE' COLORED PROTECTIVE PLASTIC ON THE CAMERA LENS. YOU CAN SURELY REMOVE THAT!! I am surprised people can't see that!! Heights of DUMBNESS!! Anyways..its definitely worth buying in this price range..Go for it!!
This phone has just lasted for only one year. It totally stopped working exactly after the warranty got over. When I took it for service, I have been asked for Rs. 8000 /- to repair the phone , the reason stated was that the phone mother board is gone. Hence I decided to buy a phone of worth Rs. 7000/- from Moto.
I bought this phone about a month ago during Diwali.. I was in ambiguity about which phone to buy . After a lot of research I finally came down to two options , one was of course Xperia M and the other being Samsung Galaxy Core . I took a survey of people around me who were using either of the two brands and I discovered that the Sony people always had a complain about their phones ! Thus, going with the mixed bag of reviews over the net and with the opinion of people around me, I made my mind to go with Core but as soon as I went to the shop with my friend , I luckily got to see Xperia M and Core unboxed and as soon as I took them in my hands I firstly compared the screens of both the phones.. Xperia M was not just brighter but faster and more beautiful too ! The only grounds on which I found Core was better was the camera quality but when I considered the other better features Sony provided , I thought with all that even that camera quality would suffice ! I immediately changed my mind and took the purple colored Xperia M ! and today I feel totally satisfied with my choice! The phone in itself makes a statement unlike the Samsung phones which are all alike .Well till now it hasn't shown any signs which makes me regret my instant decision ! Pros - * Fast processor (compared to phones of same range ) * Decent battery (stays well for 10 hours with 3G) * Stunning looks . * Good gaming experience * Kudos to the speaker and sound quality * Hd video recording Cons- * Not that great camera for stills * Internal memory is 4GB , although 4GB would cover secondary apps too ! * Apps cannot be transferred to SD card ! So that's it ! Hope it helped ! :)
I bought this a month ago (not via flipkart) and found many problems as listed below: Problems/Limitations: 1. Poor camera (more image noise). 2. Lock screen flickers. 3. No option to move apps to SD card. 4. Phone gets overheated if you play games like temple run for 15-20 minutes. Battery drains from 99% to 0% if you play games for 1.5 to 2 hours continuously. 5. Simple requirements like voice recorder, call recorder and SMS scheduling is not there. And no 3rd party call recorder is compatible with this phone. 6. Many per-installed apps like McAfee will not work. 7. Takes 20-40 minutes to charge battery from 98% to 100%. 8. Phone automatically reboots at times. 9. Music player and clarity are very poor. 10. New update did not resolve any of the above issues. Though phone comes with good hardware support, you can't really test its performance as it will not allow you to install heavy games like Asphalt 8. (unless you root the phone).
The phone claims to have a 5 MP camera but the output is not better than a VGA camera too... this is not as per Sony standards and doesnt live upto the comparison with other phones of same range.. not even the local brands. Strongly recommend DO NOT BUY.
Excellent Phone! 1.I have used 10-12 hours of internet to download new apps and only 40% of battery charge had consumed. Excellent battery performance 2.Feels weightless in hand 3.Camera quality and HD recording is awesome much better than any other 5 MP camera. 4.Sound quality best in class no other mobile in this price range provide such sound quality after this product is from SONY. Only drawback of the phone is lesser internal memory . But it’s ok, SD card memory support is there for this phone I recommend buy on this phone this is worth for your money only you need to put 1k-2k extra than other cheap brand phone.
after using the Xperia M dual for a couple of months from the date of purchase it create problems one after another like sound, battery...so on..
I have got Xperia M Dual on 16th Oct i.e. very next day of ordering. I have ordered this mobile after lot of research on net reagrding Brand, Features and price range for my wife and she is already in love with this. It comes with Android 4.2.2 while website mentiones it as 4.1. Camera is good for daily needs. Sound quality is also nice. 4 inch screen looks good in hands with better grip and controls than a bulky 5 inch screen. Xperia M Dual is very sleek and light in weight. Overall buying experience from Flipkart is great.
First of all I am amazed with the flipcart service, have ordered on 13th (Sunday) and got it delivered on very next day's afternoon. Here I want to mention that before putting an order here, I cancelled my 3 days old order on Snapdeal(Because I am getting much discounts here by using my SC card and obviously I know delivery would be much faster here.) About Phone: You all know about specs and yes they mentioning OS as 4.1 but its actually 4.2.2 when you got the package(this was my query before putting this order but they didn't clarified me). The point is to know how it feels and Simply its awesome. the touch is buttery smooth and lag free. If you are really looking a brand phone for 12000-13000 range go for it if you love brand Sony more than Samsung/Other. The Xperia thing is really giving a VIP feel. Although camera is not upto that mark but you can avoid it. There are very pretty Apps pre loaded and you will get 1.41 GB out of 4 GB internal memory of your use.
Hi Shubhanshu Sharma, In my case i got C2004 model from flipkart .. Its a dual sim phone. And while clicking photograph indoor from this phone, i can also see this blue color is quite used in every photograph.
picture quality in night time instead of ample lights is not good.internal memory is only 2gb they specify it 4 gb. hangs and restarts occassionally.:((((( not value for money
Sony is the ultimate benchmark when it comes to high quality mobile phones. Pros: 1) The phone has high quality hardware. It is great for high speed gaming. 2) Ultimate Sound. 3) Resolution is fabulous. Some people make unnecessary fuss on below components: Battery: It is long lasting. Do not listen to others who complain about it. Camera: It is very good at 5 MP. You don't need an SLR in your mobile anyway. Front Camera: Better than most of the mobiles available at this price. Internal Memory: Why you need very huge internal memory? When you can purchase 14k camera, can't you afford 400 rupees memory stick? I can bet, there is no mobile phone that can beat Sony. (At this price, ofcourse). Cons: Absolutely Nil. If you are planning any other phone in this price range, just check this phone first.
Sony offer 4gb Internal memory in xperia m dual but actually they gives only 1GB internal memory for user. and after downloading current basic application it remain only 500MB. And another joke is that you can't transfer your application on SD card or you can't set default memory as SD Card for internet downloading
high rate uncomfertable and its works so slow ang many times hang in the work walkmen not supported and many 720 videos not supported mp3 in running way and suddenly jamed
I bought this Cell 10 Months Back. Pros: A Good Overall User Experience Cons: The brand Sony refused to give any further update from Android 4.3(Jelly Bean). Hence in 4.5(Lolipop) generation I stand outdated. The Internal Usable Memory is very low and apps cannot transferred to SD card(4.3 Limitation) My cell has visited service centers of Kolkata and believe me the after sales service sucks. My cell was in the service center for 1 month due to its battery issues. Please dont get carried away by its Brand "SONY" Asus and Moto are far better choices.
Many people have complained it of poor internal memory, camera, lack of voice recorder and basic apps. Firstly, I want to clarify that it has voice recorder, unit converter and a few other apps are present as small apps which is in a different menu which many people don't know of! But it exists and is pre-installed. It has no callrecorder. But one can easily download free call recorder from play store Pros: 1)Sound clarity- very good in both earpiece and speakers 2)Loud speaker with excellent sound effects 3)Very good GPS connectivity-gets a fix in 10secs 4)extremely light weight - just 115g 5)Mic: very very good- both for video and call. Very little noise. 6)CPU/processor - highly energy efficient 7)touch response- good enough 8)Connectivity- good signal catching strength 9)Internet (3g)- fast enough for the existing speeds in India 10)RAM management- about 500-550MB free RAM in android 4.3 which is good enough. I don't know about Android 4.2 RAM management 11)Looks- Premium look. Very impressive 12)OTG connectivity- you can even get a pendrive with microUSB plug and directly stick it in 13)High quality charger with inductive beads in the cable 15)4" screen is ideal size. Neutral: Headset is of good quality but doesn't have the rubber buds. It is the flat plastic type Battery is average Useless apps like Mcafee, Paytm and about 10 others are pre-installed. It is just an irritation to uninstall, not a problem. Cons: 1)2GB internal memory and inability to move apps to SD- a big problem for gamers. But for me, I don't use more than 1GB (1Gb is still free for me after FB,Whatsapp,Twitter etc. Almost all normal apps can be easily installed as 2GB is a big amount. Only HD games are a problem 2)Still Camera is 5MP which is better than all chinese phone's 5MP cams (iball, Karbonn, micromax etc) but is poorer than all branded 5MP cams (Samsung, HTC, LG, iPhone, other Sony etc). The camera can't focus properly on objects and keeps zooming in and out. Long distance shots are quite good. But close-up is very poor. Video camera also has focus issues and keeps focusing and defocusing. 3) Has microsims instead of normal sims 4) Has back,home and multitask button on the bottom part of the screen instead of below it. So, the screen size in effect is less than 4"- about 3.7"
This phone has da best gpu in its class so u will never ever have any lags or stuttering... Itz perfect except for the battery life.. Keep one sim disabled wen u dnt need it. Drastically improves the performance
Using From Last year.. Great Product by SONY Flipkart Much cheaper than Market Price so purchased from here. Thanks
This phone is receiving updates to Android 4.3 now in India. Everything is great except the camera.... it should have been better(as if you are purchasing and expecting Sony product) Themes, NFC, Sound, Display, Touch, Software are the sure plus points of this phone.
I have been using this phone around 10 months and I am glad to chose SONY XPERIA M DUAL as my 2nd android phone. It has all the thing what a android is needed. 1. Awesome speed. no lagging. 2. Good camera both. 3. And it's sony. AWESOME SOUND!!!!!!!boooom....... 4. Headphone is also awesome. I have to admit that. 5. And a little but annoying thing is in other anroid the power button is messy. In this set the power button is smooth. Very clear and you will have the click feel. This goes too for the volume rocker. 6. I have the violet one and it's just beautiful as it's performance. 7. Touch screen is smooth. 8. Microphone and speaker is totally clear. 9. Dual sim gives all the features of having two android phones. 10. It's battery is average. But that is a fault for every android phone. So need to worry. 11. It's user interface is just as we can expect from. Funky, fashionable decent.... So what is the conclusion?? That is....In this range of price sony is giving everything that android lover wants.
first of all i would like to thank flipkart for it's fast dilevery in 3 days jzt got the phone today and i am impressed from the phone works very fast...support apps game camera is quite good notification is awesome..........also i get a external batterry as i have bought this phone from ws retail i got a sony headset free.....jzt don't think click on buy now......sound is also awesome i am very happy with this phone...the only 2 things r not good in this phone 1) we can't do 3g videocalling 2)camera is not so good ....else the phone is awesome i don;t do videocalls so it's okk fr me...awesome phone
Bought the phone seeing a lot of good reviews but regret buying. Flipkart delivery was great as usual. Within two months the phone is not getting charged, and contacting the service center was a not so good experience, the service is no good. In order to keep the phone running have to keep the phone charging the whole day which is literally not possible. I would not suggest buy this phone.
poor camera quality.. leggy.. screen quality not so good.. don't buy this piece of shit!................................
This is my 1st review on flipkart for this awsome mobile Pros= 1.Diplsay(not bad for this price this is not xperia z to complain about to get bravia display and all) 2.Hardware- Dual-core 1 GHz Krait+Adreno 305+1gb ram=Awsome performance hardly there is no lag for daily use, zero lag for me 3.Connectivity-OTG + nfc + dual band wifi(the best thing of this mobile is wifi reception is very good no other mobile at this price point can beat wifi signal reception) tested 40gb hard disk mouse keyboard via otg cable everything works smooth nfc is unexpected feature surprisingly given for xm 4.Sound quality- loud speaker sound is crystal clear with clear phase and xloud for headphone can use some 3rd party apps like power amp to make sound brillient der is a app for rooted user Viper4android install and make sound effects u will never imagine 5.Memory-For me there is no issue i rooted and used link2sd to link apps to sd Note for all new android users:If u bought a budget branded mobile just root it and dont blame on less memory or better go for some local brand like micromax..... no branded mobile like samsung sony and htc can give 8 or 16gb internal for this price see Samsung s duos 2(compitator to xperia m) it also have 2gb internal memory) 6-OS Jelly bean 4.2.2 is more delicious than samsung touch wiz and nexus just because of multi tasking like mini apps mini apps can download in play store and enjoy the multitasking Con: Camera: Though 5mp effects der the problem is in low light when zoomed the taken stills there is colour noise(mixture of RGB colours) which make image blur in day light its good For low light i suggest to use Ucam ultra app (decrease saturation in setting) which will give still with zero noise it is a software issue i guess in future we can expect those fixes overcall camera is like u need to change setting according to lightining conditions bcz automatic setting results in blur compared with lumia 520 yeah only difference i found is der is no RGB noise when zoomed photos other than both camera are same Overall its amazing mobile for daily use heard jelly bean 4.3 coming hope it fixes camera
I bought this sony xperia m dual on december 23rd 2013, i was to buy sony xperia C but its has no good features of that range, so i bought sony m dual. i enjoyed the phone for 2 months of usage and i found what are its pro's and con's. PRO's : 1. sony is enough as a brand . 2. easy and smart operation for mid user. 3. handy and perfect for all purpose usage. CON's : 1. battery is a problem, when it is in normal mode ie only calls, texting and listening music we get good back up . but when we use internet through wifi or 3g/2g the battery drains out rapidly which annoys us much . 2.camera is average, normal flash but clarity is not up to the mark. 3. memory, only 2gb memory available....which has to include apps ,photos and vedios . no apps can be moved to sd card. 4.finally phone gets heated up while playing games or watching vedios . Conclusion : there are many phones which are better than this phone at this price mark. but Sony is brand mark to buy this product. A mid range user will definetly enjoy but soon gets bored of using it.
The phone is so light and thin that you think you are holding a wafer. The overall feel and finish is top notch. Battery back up is good and LED notification is awesome. Buttons given at the right side are of premium quality. Samsung's phones are nowhere close to it. I am using purple colour. Who says purple is meant for gals only? Sick of seeing black and white handsets. One minor con: Phone gets warm while surfing on 3g and playing games. While using over a wifi heating issue is not there.
I bought this product just because of its brand.. but just to find out that even Sony can have manufacturing defects. A brand new phone is giving me 'Insufficient memory space available' when I try to download any app. And surprisingly there is no option to move the existing apps to sd card. Worst camera performance comparing it with other mobiles with a 5MP camera. think twice before you buy this product...
I brought it on December..Its really sad part of the phone that any software can not be move or installed in the SD card(basic anroid phones supports),Only 2 gb place for end user!!!!
I bought this Xperia M dual last month(for 11.9k coz of a cash back offer).As a Mid range smart phone,Sony Xperia M dual is loaded with the lot of features that worth the money. A major issue is the battery.when using navigation apps and wifi data,battery drains quickly.for an entire day battery life you need to sacrifice Multimedia related usage. Another draw back is the camera.but if you are not interested in photography then it's good to go with Xperia M dual. Flipkart delivery is superb.delivered before the expected date.
I bought sony xperia M dual 20 days ago. Bad Battery backup and my phone work for average of 7 hours per day by using wifi otherwise its work for 16 hours only.
Hi All, I bought this Sony Xperia dual sim phone 2 weeks before. The flipkart delivered the product on the immediate next business day. And the price also was very cheap on that day. I bought it for Rs. 12910. Thanks Flipkart. Pros: 1. Music Quality is good. 2. Android 4.2.2 version. 3. Processing speed is good. Also, You can load N number of applications. 4. Compared to other products like Samsung, Nokia and XOLO this product is awesome in this price range. 5. HD recording option is good. Cons: 1. Camera quality is good, but moving objects are not getting captured properly. 2. Phone's battery is drying fast if you use Wifi and games.
sony xperia m smart phone is amazing for there sound quality and better performance also hit like for a gamer.1 GB RAM nd 1 GHz processor are enough also qualcomm snapdragon S4 pro are better than samsung galaxy core and also screen resolution are enough for HD video. I like this Smart phone
I am using this cell from last 3 to 4 moths. its quite pretty and awesome bt camera quality is low and it is hanging up while downloading or updating the apps.battery back up is good. go for it.
A good phone in this range, processing speed is good, display clearity is good, plenty of preloaded applications, sound also good. Camera diappoints in low light, but never mind who uses camera of phone for photografy in night!!! overall best in this segment
worth for the money. can't install the software in SD card. battery is average. rest everything is good.
Earphones available in the box piece are not at all good.. I really expected good quality earphones but disappointed. We have to purchase extra earphones for good music experience. One more thing, apps cannot be shared as we do in samsung phones. Optiopn is given for sharing, but when u go for it, the cursor starts rotating and doesnt go further unless you stop it. Apps cannot be transferred to SD card and internal memory is less for big games.
donot buy this product. all featuures is good except camera. camera feature asa given by manufacture 5 MP but it is less than 1MP just like china model. if any body intersted i will sell my model only rs 10000. one type of this is fraud activity given by sony company.as per my view actual price of this product is just rs 5000.
Great product from Sony!! I had been using Samsung smartphones and thought of buying this mobile and it does not disappoint at all. The price range for the phone is too irreristible. The camera quality is good and positioning of the click button is very convenient for using front camera too. Sound quality is superb. App centre has plenty of choices. Battery is just ok. Recommend this phone for mid-range users.

First thanks to flipkart for awesome service...my order is just delivered within a 3days...! Flipkart is make a mistake in a mobile os... flipkart say it has Android 4.1 But actually it has Android 4.2.2 SO many pre-loaded apps such as what;app , facebook.. & much more about 30+apps are preloaded. good processing speed ,,,& killer look..! BUT less memory is a problem if you are not hardcore gamer then no problem... it has only 2gb memory for user but generally apps take 1gb memory & cache take about 500mb that mean only 500mb free space available in a phone memory... in short you not able to play huge games such as asphalt 8(1.5GB) , NFS MW(2GB),,...
i am using since 5days. in these 5days i lost 5 to 10 calls daily becoz of low singal in this phone. before this i used lumia 520 i never faced any signal problem with that. but it is irritating me i have to search signal area to place this phone. and camera is worst than worst. pics are looking like yellowish colored and zoomed pictures are worst. Nokia 2MG pixel camera is better than this... Fully Disappointed of this...Shit
I bought this product after a lot of research on the internet and at last I am happy that I made the right call. Now let me share some of my experiences with this cell. I will start with display :- 10/10 The looks and display of the phone is perhaps the best feature of this cell and to say that the display of this cell is second to none won't be exaggerating. Battery life - 9/10 I had wished for a longer battery life but at this price range you can't complain much. Gaming and Multitasking :- 10/10 - I have used this cell for what not sorts of games and the processor didn't glitch for even once. The cell works as smooth as anything. Camera 6/10 - This is the least impressive feature of this cell and kind of looks like a blot on otherwise a near perfect cell. Touch and other features such as music and sound are a 10/10 and the cell comes with xLOUD which amplifies the sound without compromising the quality. It comes loaded with Android 4.2.2 and some other preloaded applications which are appreciable. Both the dual sims work well in standby mode as compared to some other dual cells I have used where if one signal is weak then the cell doesn't catches that signal. I haven't used the NFC feature so no comments on it. After using this cell for around two weeks I can safely say that you won't regret ever buying this cell and with all the mentioned features and add to that the class of sony, there's nothing more you can for at this price. Therefore if you are looking for something in this price range then do ponder over this cell.
1 very important point i wish to make. Just like many of other Sony phones, this wont support Ultra fast memory card (class 10) the latest1. I thought , the problem is with my card but after googling, I found that many people have the same problem. I am using 16GB SanDisc ultra and it would keep on saying "SD card unexpectedly removed". Unfortunately even after 3rd device update SONY is not in mood to fix this issue. Rest phone is good in terms of looks specially, but yes camera in night mode is a disappointment. Also internal memory will remain an issue for sure. I have been using this for 3 months now.
I've used this mobile from last two months and I feel that the phone is totally worst mobile phone. 1. Its camera quality is so so so so so poor. 2. Its battery drains very quickly if you play games, listening music, using wi-fi and internet. 3. You can't install apps and games in sd card and even you can't move it in sd card too. I won't suggest anyone to purchase this phone because this is a very very very worst phone.
The phone is not up to the mark according to its price. Available memory is only 1.9 gb for end use which is for apps and multimedia files. Apps can't move to the external memory. If you save a video files of 500 mb then your available memory is very low for apps. Camera gives very poor quality in low light. Actually nokia 2 mp camera is better than this. Only one positive point is sound quality. galaxy core in this budget far better from this giving 8 gb internal. where 4 gb is for apps and 4 gb is for multimedia files. Another positive point is apps are movable to external card. screen size is 4.3 where sony gives only 4 inch screen. I am very disappointed with the phone bcoz of memory concern.
I have purchased from flipkart delivered 2 days late it's no issue now product pors-good display, touch is smooth, bettry is average Cons -no directly video call support, internal memory is 2Gb and only one primary partition for apps, apps data, download files and shared files no separate partition for apps and internal sd card apps cannot move to sd card no option for that,poor network reception, If you call from sim 1 then lost the network of sim2, memory issues after installation of twenty apps you can not intall more than 512 mb .it's so made in China so better if you by a Chinese phone you can get under 8000 more features than sony xperia m dual.sony and samsung fooling indian peoples.I disappointed. cannot recommend don't by friends this mobile is not like as 12000
WHICH PEOPLE GIVE GOOD REVIEW ON THIS PHONE PLEASE TRY IT..in that when i turn on second sim for internet connectivity there is first sim network go disappear..no one can call on first sim number..i use four service provider sim card (Vodafone,BSNL,Idea,Airtel).that is the major issue in this phone. altough there is a problem still in the mobile..and yes service center not able to give the solution of this problem..very very poor phone...
If you are a person who hates buying phones from cheap companies such as Micromax, Karbonn etc, this is the phone for you under 15000. Pros: 1.Great Screen Clarity - Even though it is not a HD phone it is just as good as any HD phone. 2.Great Audio - Audio clarity is awesome. The call volume is also quite good and can be easily heard even in loud areas 3.Stunning Looks - Do i need to say more??. Its SONY!!! 4.Super after sales service - Sony provides the best after sales service along with Nokia and Samsung. 5.Dual Sim with great range - Even if you are in low range area the phone can pick up even the faintest signals. This is where it trumps the low end devices of other manufacturers. Cons: It still has a few problems but it is 100% solvable 1.Low internal memory - This prevents the installation of heavy games because of the measly 2GB internal. But this can be solved with a simple root. And dont worry about rooting your warranty. Sony doesn't consider rooting as a warranty voider unless you brick your device. Follow this simple to guide to fix the memory problem and install heavy games. 2. Not great for very heavy usage - The battery life is moderate. With normal usage it can easily last 2-3 days but if you are a heavy user it lasts just a day. 3. Screen could have been a little bigger - The 4' screen is great for normal people but if you have big fingers you might find it difficult to message. But this can also be solved by replacing the default xperia keyboard with swift key from android market as its user interface is much bigger and easier to use.. 4. Speaker problem - Due to some manufacturing errors, 1 in 100 Xperia M duals have a speaker problem. But dont sweat. This is not a problem as Sony provides free speaker replacement for the above problem within 2 days. 5. Camera not good not bad - The camera is not that good but considering that this is a mid range phone its acceptable. The 5MP still leads the competition but is not as good as what you find in Lumia 620. Still this can also be partly solved by using camera apps other than the default preinstalled one. This is only a partial solution because hardware cannot be improved with an app. Overall its another great phone from SONY and the dual sim gives it yet another boost. Some might say that the samsung galaxy s duos is cheaper and has better features and so does the Canvas series from micromax or the karbonn titanium. This is bulls**t. Can you ever compare a Ferrari with a Truck?? Just because it is cheaper and bigger doesn't mean its better!! Still there are some alternatives 1. Lumia 620 - Great phone but its not android after all and so lesser apps.And also the good apps cost you money. Everything else is almost same and it has a slightly better camera. 2. Moto G - Its another great phone but its camera sucks too. Another problem is that it has a NON removable battery, so if there is a battery problem after the warranty period then the only thing that your phone can be used for is as a paperweight 3. Galaxy Core - For those who still think Ferraris can be compared to trucks this is the phone for you. You might as well buy this if you are interested in big ugly phones made of cheap plastic. 4. Canvas Turbo Mini - If you are on a tight budget and want a big fat phone stuffed with features this is the one for you. But beware..it is from micromax after all. One defect and you will be running to and fro for service. If you are looking for phones from popular brands look no further ...this is absolutely the one for you ....
Sony has reduced quality or flipkart cant say. overheating, hang, and very slow is common problem. We had not expected such bad product from sony. Please dont buy this mobile at any cost totally useless. RAM consumption is always 80% in just few application.
I suggest go for Huawei Ascend G700 at price 15000~ Worth every paise!! You get 5 inch HD sceen,Dual Active Sim, with Quad Core 2GB RAM & 8MP Camera. The price needs to be around 10,000 for this Xperia M. I used sony before, you will be only satisfied by the Brand not the hardware. UPDATED NOTE: ALL THE EXISTING PHONES WILL BE OUTDATED IN ANOTHER 6 MONTHS AND NEW TREND OF 64 BIT PROCESSOR IN ANDROID L WILL START.
apps are very good. But call forwading is very slow,,It cant use for calling...bad performance very bad
I bought this phone through flipkart. Phone is awesome and delivery was super fast. Loved it. Not getting into too much detail about the phone. I am not here to write a detailed review but to ask the users of this phone that how do i install whatsapp?? I m facing a problem with my whatsapp installation. I downloaded the latest version and installed it but getting stuck up at the "verification code" step. Every time it says"not connected to internet"(but it's connected) and i fail to get verification code both through SMS and voice mail. I contacted Whatsapp customer support but of no use. Can anyone out here help me with this???
I am writing this review after using Xperia M duos for 10 days.I bought this phone after reading lot of positive reviews.I didn,t bought this phone from flipkart. bcoz i was getting 1.5K cheaper than flipkart (1 week after my purchase, flipkart suddenly dropped 1.3K in its price). Earlier I was using Samsung star II duos ffor more than 2 years, which was a great phn, specially camera & build quality (it dropped out of my hands hundred times, but nothing happns like nokia). Now, I wanted to switch to android phone with dual sim, < 4" screen, latest processor, 1GB RAM, and Good enough internal mamory, with never hanging out problms. Samsung handsets, thought with good features, due to software problem in dual sim sets was out of catogary. So I chose SONY Xperia M dual and HTC desire X dual, HTC phone like desire X and desire V, being good looking phones were provided with low configuration, less features as compared to Xperia M. XPERIA M: 1 . Nice build quality and ergonomics ( being 4", its quite handy and doesn't look odd, particularly like micromax HD or samsung grand) 2. Smooth touch and scratch resistant screen ( no need of screen guard :-) ) 3. Latest good quality processor Qualcomm snapdragon S4 pro, enough 1GB RAM, and with 2GB available internal memory. 4. Very nice HD video recording with crystal clear sound recording (it has separate mic near rear camera for recording). thats what sony is known for.... 5. It comes with a few less important pre-installed apps, which u can uninstall it if u dont want them. 6. 5MP camera is not bad if photographer know how to snap best. 7. Awesome sound quality with high bass...And No hanging problem till now Conc.: 1. Battry goes rapidly down on using 3G althought its 1750 battry,.....(thats a problm with evry 3G phone) but it last long whole day using 2G, or disabling 3G when not in use. 2. Camera is not enough good in night or low light.
very nice phone bt if we move toward c then we'll get quad core and 8 mp camera.5" display ...about 4000 rs ....confused ...which wil b better
No words to say just blindly go for it.. better than outdated samsung looks and specifications.. but dont buy from flipkart, its always priced higher than market rate.. and go for the black one.. u will never regret your purchase..
I was expecting a lot from this phone. It was fitting all the requirements I was looking for. But, but, but.... It has some real issues 1) Phone gets heated up, both on the front side(top) and back side. This is on very minor usage for calling or playing game for some time. Or turning on 3G data service for 5 minutes. 2) It reboots pretty frequently, and after reading at some forums, it seems because of overheating, the phone reboots itself 3) The battery gets discharge very fast, does not last one full day.
1. Phone is heating, if use 5 to 10 min continuously. 2. Camera quality is not up to 5MP, ITS TERRIBLE (3 MP Good in Samsung) 3. Battery is discharging very fast(even in ideal state or in 2g) 4. Screen size is 4 inch, but display screen is not 4 inches. 5. Internal memory is not 4 GB, it is 2GB to install Apps. 6. Hangs frequently. 7. Never connect Data in 1 attempt, some times you need to restart the hand set. 8. Never connect Wi-Fi in 1 attempt, some times you need to restart the hand set. I returned the product. First time I get terrible problem with SONY. Sony Mobile phone products are not worth.
the worst battery i have ever come a cross, doesnt even last a daytime. In standby stamina mode the phone shows that, estimate standby time is 15 days but within 2 hours 10-12 % battery runs out in standby mode, i even adjusted the brightness to nil than also of no use. currenty i am not using it for calls as i have given my no. for portability and it will take 7 days time for porting, just using it for whats app and candy crush game than also such poor performance of battery. I feel the camera is not up to the mark as read in reviews. otherwise the phone is good performance wise. But without a good battery every thing is a waste, as u cannot use it
I own a sony xperia M dual smart phone. It is very smart and i found it hang every time when i want to use it..
Bought this mobile as I was crazy about Sony. It was my first smartphone. It looks classy slim and stylish. The Sony walkman is terrific and fantastic. The camera has good clarity at times only when compared to moto g mobiles.But it has a lot of built in apps that unless you root your device you cant get more memory.It hangs rarely that too after 9 or 10 months . The charge gets down easily that I had to use a power bank when I travel.The biggest drawback is the charging usb port. Its gets affected easily within few months say 6 months of usage itself. Even if you fix the issue after service under warranty it will likely damage again after 1 year surely which wont cover under warranty. I had major problem with that. The touch of the homescreen,minimize abd back buttons have gone after 1 year of usage. So for one year the phone would be awesome worth the rate but if you are going for long term usage as I paid 13000 for the mobile though its price has become less recently felt bad that my crazy Sony M mobile is not effective after 1 year.
am place order in flipkart ,after 1week i write my review 1st say advantages ,camera quality good ,no lag problem , multitask at same time , very slim Disadvantage battery drain very fast heating problem while take pics or speaking in call and charging time 1.5 gb only internal memory in this memory all apps safe not possible to add in sd cards conclusion if u want sony brand thn go buy xperia m dual at 7000 if ur budget more thn 7000 thn go for samsung
PRODUCT FEATURES ARE GOOD, BUT TOUCH SCREEN OS OVER SENSITIVE. SUGGESTION TO IMPROVE ON THAT. OTHERWISE PRODUCT IS GOOD.
I have been using this mobile for the past one and a half year. I didn't buy it from Flipkart, I bought it from a local shopkeeper. I bought it around for 12k with cover and screen guard. Overall, I am happy with after using it more than a year. Pros: 1. TFT Display is very good. 2. Classy, sleek design. Size and weight proportionate. (4 inch) 3. Processor (1 GHz + Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro, Dual Core), OS Android v4.2 (Jelly Bean) appropriate. 4. Sound and Mic quality good. Battery usage okay. Cons: 1. Camera is a big disappointment. Trust me, this is the major problem/disappointment of this handset. It says 5MP, but the quality is, if not else, have to say, just better than a VGA camera, maybe, at night. Pictures under sunlight (appropriate amount of exposure are okay although). 2. 2GB Internal Storage is not sufficient either, by any means. Overall, this is an okay buy at Rs. 10490(now). Cheers.
You want to so update the apps it will take up 80% of the internal memory ,so you cannot install games! Camera is average only when the light is good so huge set back when it comes to anytime photo!
i purchase this phone 10 months ago and after i was visited 10 times with same problem. its service is too poor . very slow phone . RAM is every time with nothing running aaplication. Its very HOT phone any times it is heated and more when you get it charged . I requested Guys plz dont buy this phone its totally wasteage of money . Even i say you dont go to any sony products because of its service.
Good screen clarity. Dual sim is added advantage. battery backup is good. Cam clarity is good. Gifted this phone to my dad. He is very happy.
1. Video Quality - 5/5 (Very Good color production) 2. Sound Quality - 5/5 (Excellent Sound Quality) 3. Call Quality - 4.5/5 (Very Good Call Quality) 4. Display Quality - 5/5 (Very good brightness and color reproduction) 5. Connectivity - 5/5 6. Battery - 3.5/5 (Above Average) 7. Camera - 5/5 (good) 9. Look and Feel - 5/5 (Very Good look)
This phone is amazing, its not for you if u want a techy techy phone , but otherwise it is really good, the battery life is ok, it has a low internal memory and come wit pre installed apps that you cant get rid off which is a minus point. The phone looks amazingly sleek and has given me good service
bot this cell Sony Xperia M Dual to gift, a gr8 cell to be gifted to someone, cheap and gr8 combination.
camera quality is not that much good. front cam should be atleast 2MP, other than that everything is fine.
Performance is good. Camera resolution is average. With Sony as brand...its kind of economic model with basic features.
Sony mobile phones are the worst phones I have ever used, in terms of reliability. All of the Sony phone have a common problem with the MIC. After using the phone for a while, the MIC of the device started malfunctioning. Outgoing voice from the mobile was not audible to the person you are talking to. Initially this use to happen only for a few seconds between the conversations, but once I gave it for servicing, condition worsened. Now, most of the time, I am not able to talk to anyone without keeping the phone on Speaker mode. This is pathetic, never expected from a brand like Sony. If it was Samsung or Micromax, I would have excepted the defect. But not with Sony. All my friends who have got a Sony mobile phone are facing the same MIC issue. Everyone is frustrated of it now and is cursing the company. I would never go for a Sony device again and neither would suggest any friend. Its a waste of money.
Good product.Has option of Dual Sim.Though micro sim. Sony always known for Camera and Music and hence worth it.. Delivery on time and as committed by Flipkart Worth a purchase...
I need Sony Xperia M Dual (Black) with in this month,I like black color kindly update stack with in this month end
Not satisfied with the price i ask in the market sony xperi mdual price is 11000 and here it is mopre than 11000 what is the benefit
A moderate product. Its almost one year since I am using this phone. No major issues but , Camera is not good and its not possible to move apps to sd card.
Experience: Xperia M dual is a good option for everyone going for a new android mobile... Suggestion: Need to add more internal storage... Me and My Phone: For the last 7 months,i am using this Phone... Overall: Good,Value for Money....
I ordered this product and it was delivered on time. Kindly note that all things mentioned are good. Those who are buying it expecting the same features as shown.
Was an excellent choice for this price range. Battery backup was also excellent. I was very happy with the experience. But after one year of use, its very slow now. Even basic functions like making call is pain now a days. Dont understand why it hangs so much.Even if the memory is 30% empty and RAM is 40% empty, still the responsiveness is gone. May be some software update resolve the issues. The battery backup is still good. would have been happy to give this phone a 4 star.
It just looks so awesome and classy. Pros : 1. Battery backup 2. Sound quality 3. Weight Cons : 1. Very bad camera 2. Non-gorilla screen
I have been using this phone for about a year now. I had written a previous review giving them good rating, which was sort of just after buying ...and it seemed great then ..but I must say even then for the price I paid, i was certainly not a best buy! Well, over the time I experienced some radical flaws which were initially not experienced. They were: 1- I dont have much of data and neither I play big games but still phone lags sometimes and hengs a bits ( not too often though) 2- processing is slow when I open call log to dial a number, most times, it takes a while to show the recent calls. 3- most annoying is phone going on "hold mode" while talking to someone. This happens because when you are talking your ear tend to touch the screen frequently. but, if it touches , which of course you cant take a track, the right top corner twice, it goes on hold. I am used of this shit happening most times now. to continue, than manually you have to press " Retrieve call" or else you will talking to yourself for sure. I thought this will be improved with new updates ..but NO and now i have given up. 4- Camera is ok...nothing great .. 5- battery is decent. Screen is amazing though... my suggestion : even if Sony sells it for 8K, dont fall for it!
All i can say, its a nice phone to buy. Not hanging like Samsung. the only problem is its graphics quality . Rest everything sounds good.
Value for money product from Sony, the con is low internal memory. Of the 2 GB internal memory only approx 250 MB is available for use which disables it from installing many applications.
Hello, I m using this cell since one year its good product in all aspects axcept camara clearity!!!! seems 2 MP camara...
It is beautiful one from Sony. I am using this phone for more than 1 year. Earlier I was using Nokia 603. The phone is good but it has worste signal reception and then finally I choosen to by new one. Pros 1: good signal reception and voice quality. 2: good design and sturdy enough. 3: good battery life. 4: OTG is fine that is not available for many phone. Cons: 1: bad camera for low light condition. 2: internal memory should have been increased. Final word is that it does it's job beautifully by providing good signal reception and providing average multimedia experience.
It is one of the best cell phones in 13000 rupees range. Go buy it, it will not disappoint you. I am using it since one year and I am very satisfied with its performance.
Dear Friends, I have been using this mobile for last six months. Hence, thought to write my experience about this phone. This phone looks nice and all basic phone qualities are good. However, this phone lags with some important features. For example - 1. You cannot move applications to memory card. Hence, you are restricted to only 2 GB memory. 2. Camera quality is not at all good during night. Even though it has a flash, still picture quality is bad. 3. The speaker volume is very low. If you play any music on speaker, it's not very loud and quality goes down. 4. Sometimes echo happens for own voice. Hence, in my opinion it is not a good option with cost around 11,000. There are better phones available in market which are better than this. Thanks
I am writing this review after almost year since i purchased this product. 1 Good experience in 1 year use >Sony Xperia M Dual is really working nice even if it has fell few times from height of 2-3 feet. >It rarely hung while operating. >Sound quality is superior. Sony has always overcome in music department >Its slim and good build quality very good in handling. When i first handled the device it was so slim and elegantly designed body felt very light weight. >Display Brightness is good at lowest level and highest brightness level is viewable in bright sunny day. 2. Bad experience in 1 year use >Camera quality was not good compared to other 5 MP smartphones, however update to Android 4.3 gave some boost to camera. >4GB internal memory is not enough when you have only 2 GB usable memory. >some times it was slow in operation running low on RAM When it was launched it was a very good phone to purchase even though after a year, smartphones like Moto G have become more popular and giving more quality hardware than Xperia M
Design is good also the front camera is touching to the level of sony. But the front camera is totally worst. This phone is very slow in processing, you will be getting bored after using 1 months.
WITH THE AWESOME LOOK OF BODY ITS AMEZZZZZ JST AMAZZZZ BUT THE HAVE TO GIVE IT 4.4 KITKAT .............................................................................................................................................................................................
I have been using this cellphone for past 5 months and I must say Sony has done it again. Getting an android phone this cheap with these many features is just amazing. So, I'm gonna list the pros and cons for the product. PROS: 1. Camera 5MP - 9/10 2. Music player - 9/10 3. Screen Touch - 9/10 4. Video Recording - 9/10 5. Battery - 6/10 6. Style - 10/10 CONS: 1. Internal Memory - Its just 2gb for your apps and the apps cant be transferred to SD card. So, you cant install big apps/ games. - 5/10 2. Overheating - Gets overheated while talking to someone for more than 10 min. So, I use the earphones for talking. Summing up, this is a good smartphone for this range and if you are interested in buying this, then please go for it.
what a service by flipkart & wat a phn by sony. simply best under 11k. if u r going for it.... thumbs up
I bought this phone for my cousin. He is happy with this. Only one issue with this phone is "You can't move your application and games to memory card". Otherwise good phone. Regards, Ashish S.
Camera quality not satisfying as Brand Sony. Nokia has better camera quality even without flash. Kitkat upgrade required.
I'm not too happy with the product,Very deliacate ,you have to handle it very carefully. once accidently phone was slipped out of my hand,display problem started. I took it to the service center ,they have replaced the 3 internal parts. Since it was under warranty,I din't pay anything. About Flipkart: I'm happy the service
Guys trust me I bought this Sony Xperia M Dual and there is no issues with this good looking phone.Before buying this phone I gathered few info about micromax, samsung, karbon and nokia and htc.But I bought this Xperia only. There are few people who looks for 2-4 ram quad core/octa core processor huge memory and ram but they never think that what will they do with these features if camera does not work properly , if sound quality is poor if display is like china phone GABA. So, please go for xperia handset and enjoy music, good screen resolution and sexy looks.And please forget about big TV screen size china phone.
Sony name is itself enough. It a good budget phone in this range. Design is awesome. sound is great for lisitng music. HD recording is also good. 5 megapixel camera is nice. But secondary camera is not much good. one more thing internal memmory is only 4gb and app are unmovale to external memmory card. So you can install less app on it. Overall phone is very cool and nice to use.
its a good experience but still i not recv. my sbi 10�sh back amount as per deat i m little upset i wrote this after 20 days of purchasing pls reply surender sehgal
Firstly abt the service..... Thanx to Flipkart for a good service. It was delivered in just 3 days. Now about the phone I tell you Its a great one, super sexy & slim. Friends one more thing I want to tell you that please put a back cover before using because the rubbery back takes some hand impressions and its hard to remove it!. Its very light in weight only 115 g. So in my opinion I am happy with this phone and friends don't worry you can also go with it... ;-)
I have purchased Sony Xperia M Dual in Oct. 2013. Its really good mobile with good feature. Only drawback i that it not support gujarati fonts and you cannot move you app into memory card. Otherwise Camera & Movie is good. Process wise is good & sound quality is good.
Its a Again A grt service by Flipkart, Great Going Flipkart Team....... About the Product Pros : Good 4" screen Android 4.2.2 Nice design Sony music quality Battery life is good Good wifi reception Dual Micro Sim Cons : 5 mp camera not produce good result Only 2GB Internal memory for end user Memory expansion slot is useful for media only not application and games Again I will thank you to flipkart for their Fast Service , Other courier services should learn how to deliver the product with safety & with speedy delivery tooo.....
I have recieved defective piece. Seller is VTM. I baught product from Flipcard.There is only 10days return policy. you can not apply for return on 11th day. Display of photoes taken by camera is defective. Also photoes by rear Camera are very poor while object is in little movement. I am not able to take single good photo of my son, as childs are not steady. Do not buy this phone if you want average or Good quality photographs.
not satified....don't for this mb....when i got this phn in 2 days it doent function properly... it gets heaten up and even there was a pblm with camera it has 5 mp but i didnt thk so i get a quality of 5mp pic .... it was ma 1st experience with sony but i m not satisfiedt with this phne.. so dont go for this phone
When i tried to insert BSNL SIM card in it, i found the the panel to put SIM card is looking so small. I tried with Micro SIM also but same remains same,
the mobile is so good! camera quality is super! no words to say about demerits of this mobile , mobile look is beautiful
Memory is limited for apps; only 1.5 GB usable; Since I am not a serious gamer... did not load/try any huge app to test performance Camera has good lens to capture photo, but inbuilt software blurs the images upon saving. Sound is good enough. Battery is OK for a day with occasional internet & gaming (drains bit fast while playing games)
I had purchased this phone for one of my friend he is quite happy with the overall performance of the phone. battery backup is good sound is superb.
Flipkart is genuine... No doubt about it. I am extremely happy to buy a product evry now and then from flipkart.
Slim design.. not so heavy to handle.. wow apps.. first time using android its feels great to use it in xperia.. nd yes heating problem is there.. but it is only while playing games and videos.. hope to have great with this phone... :)
Ok, the wait is over and product is in hand. Have been using it from past 4 days, Ordered it a pre-order and to my surprise received it in 3 days (Thanks to flipkart and WS Retail). * Android Version= 4.2.2 (very good) * Display= Very good * Looks and feel= Classy, sleek, handy with right size and weight * Battery= Not very good but acceptable ( 1 day for an average usage) * Camera= Good pictures for the price point ( for regular photos it is very decent) * Sound Quality= Excellent * Mic Quality= Excellent (i am mentioning this because with my previous phone i had to repeat my words loudly for the other person to understand, now when i talk to people they say that the sound is extremely clear even when i speak very softly) * Process speed= Decent * Memory= Internal 4 gb ( around 2 gb free to download apps), this android version does not support moving apps to SD card, ok for average users but i would prefer with this option without rooting * Sony apps= Excellent * Dual Sim= While on call on one sim, the other sim goes to stand by. While using data on one sim, both sims are active. It is a very good phone at this price point (compared to android phones), looks and sound clarity are its USP.
Good Phone at this price. Enough to buy product from flipkart. If looking for more than 4 inch screen opt for different phone
When I got the phone it was working pretty well. But after updating the device and using for just over a week, the phone is over heating. There was also a faint smell of burning but it's not that noticeable. The heating occurs anytime we play a video for a few minutes or do any processor intensive work, just fir like 5 minutes. First I thought it may be an issue with my phone only bit after searching on the Internet, others to have this problem.
I have been searching a good phone with clear music output for past 6 months. Now I'm settled with this. The display is also very nice with beautiful graphics. Sony's design is the best both software and hardware.
Well a good product from sony. Feels good in hand. Sexy design. Screen clarity good. Audio quality good. Camera is good but front camera is not upto the mark. Doesnt get slow even when i opened multiple windows. Battery drains quickly when switched to 3G. Biggest disadvantage it gets heated up very quickly when playing games and another disadvantage is that you cannot move any app from phone memory to sd card which means that you are restricted to only a few apps. Hope this helps you.
...........................................very good mobile for the best price from flip kart........................................................
As usual Flipkart delivered the item on time. But packing was not much good. The same product if you look at other vendor price, flipkart has higher. About the product: As brand product, SONY maintained that what user expects. Overall the quality of the product is good. But shows tower single as weak.
all's gud except camera.....camera is very poor and just below the standards of 5 MP .... its like a 2 MP camera
its a awsome deal with flip kart and also yeti mobiles they deliver it in only 3 days and mobile comes with a updated and. version i.e. 4.3. the product is genuin and in brand new awsome condition.great deal
Whenever you go for the Sony don't demand everything... Sony believe in quality... not the performance.. This mobile will last for many year without service.. but I herd bad review personally but I bought this mobile with my own risk and it is working fine for last 6 months.. Now come to the performance of this mobile.. 1. Processor : 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro, Dual Core This processor is long lasting processor than cortex or mediateck... But i am little upset with this mobile because i bought today Gionee P2S which give much better performance than this mobile.. 2. Ram : 1GB is good for this one... 3. Camera : 5MP captures the picture which looks bad over the mobile.. But when you transfer this to laptop / computer it looks pretty awesome [Natural Colour] 4. Webcam : 0.3 MP is good or you can say it average.. 5. Speaker : No doubt with the Sony sound.. So no comments.. It is 10/10 from me. 6. looks : 9.9/10 7. Battery : Have to give charge everyday if you call for 1hr, do wifi for 1hr, data usage for 1hr, play music over full volume for 5-6 hr... I am not satisfy with the battery backup.. 5/10 8. Display : Make Dot Believe.. no comments.. It's Awesome... 9 : Style : while the mobile Starts it shows fire waves, which loooks good...... The body colour [purple] looks amazing... If you want for showoff the colour is best [purple] Slim And handy
Poor camera, poor sound on speakers. Otherwise an ok product. Flipkart delivery is simply the best...
Camera clarity is bad at low light.All other features are good .Regularly update of OS if available.Sound quality is good.
I have not bought this phone from Flipkart but from market. This phone is really amazing... It has been more than a week i am using this device and its really fantastic. Sony has made this phone like anything. In just 11K you are getting dual core, 1 GB RAM, and the main thing is its Sony... Pros:- 1. NFC Support. 2. Dual Core and 1 GB RAM makes is faster. 3. Dual Sim. 4. Long battery life more than a day. 5. Good camera quality. 6. Handy i.e. 4 inch display. Cons:- 1. No cons. If someone is explaining cons of this phone please use samsung first with the price range of 11K then post a review for this phone.
I have been using Sony M Dual from Jan 2014. After Seven month of usage, first drawbacks: 1. Camera quality can't be compared to sony standards(both camera) 2. Hardware is not good, facing problem of Teathering and GPS not working(Checked with friends:- all have any one HW issues like sd card slot issue) 3. RAM not sufficient for updates for APPs.. (ex: Factory version of chrome is 2MB, but latest version is 30MB app) Advantage: 1. Good build quality, 2. Budget phone.
Slim, light weight and good interface makes this a phone an awesome phone but i am not satisfied with the camera of this phone.
I am writing this review after three months of using this phone. First of all thanks to flipkart for their amazing service, the delivery and packaging was excellent. Now about the phone, well not much to say, the name tells most of it, its from Sony. After three moths of usage there is no lag, no issues whatsoever. Recently updated to official Android 4.3 jelly bean, since then the phone is performing like vanilla in butter. I personally like sony's almost stock android ui. Pros: excellent sound quality( clear phase, clear bass, clear stereo, clear audio+, xloud) very good processing power very good gpu good camera(after the update) multimedia apps( walkman, album, movies) receives monthly updates and they are unbeatable in performance very good display(4 inch fits perfectly for one hand use) lots of sensors noise cancellation during calls is escellent excellent wifi reception cons: Nothing in my point of view, as its full filling all my daily needs very well. So if you wanna buy a smartphone under 12000 and from a global leader in technology with very good after sales service then this is the one. Thank you....
overall performance is awesome. But the delivery from flipkart was irritating. The flipkart agent called me 2 minutes before he reaches my address and he has given to the near by room without informing me. The mobile charging is worse if you use 2 sims + mobile data ON. But with 1 sim+ mobile data ON charging is ok. The sony support is very good.
I bought this phone from Sony showroom for 12500/- I have been using this phone since last 8-9 months. Since last 2 months I have been facing problem of charging the phone. I found that port is not properly soldered with the board. So, when you keep it for charging it won't charge but it keeps showing the phone is getting charged. I got it repaired but again the same problem occurred. After some research/google I found that this is very common problem with Xperia M Dual Rest everything is fine with this phone.
Overall Nice phone for this price.. Camera not so good, bluetooth connectivity makes intermittent beeps, annoying.
Flipkart service is awesome as always. And regarding the device again i have gone for SONY xperia. This is my 4th purchase from sony xperia . I would say Just go for it.
Sony name is enough for quality of product. Xperia M dual proves its "Sony" in all department except its camera. Camera is not upto the mark. Another factor is you cant install application on SD Card.
Good Battery life, Good Camera, Very fast, I love it. Good mobile for games.............................................................................................................................................................
Xperia M dual is superb for me lookwise, speed , cam, processor and ol... although the front cam is not gud as usual in case of all sony ph. bt except this ph is really fantastic... battry is ok one more the screen resolution is really very bright even in low brightness and luks is awesome and give looking of apple...
i got almost all features in this mobile ...which i didnt get in high range models............................................................................................
vry descent phone ... good quality sony product... though its 1GHz still ok not a gr8 problem up till now though the bluetooth feature is quite not up to the mark , as if u send multiple file to other user they have 2 accept every file one by one...that becomes quite irritating.. besides that i am having a vry good time and the lasting is also ok...
Quite Good - with design and OS Pricing - Affordable Weight - Less weight Needs full Usage of Data to update the apps and software's Reasonable speed and user friendly Official Usage not impressive you can only read the documents
ti"s fantastic RAM and Processor Good loke SONY XPERIY Review: Before you decide that "is Sony Xperia M Dual the best smart phone I wanna buy?"
Fantastic Phone. Very good battery life for a dual SIM phone. Only problem is GPS going down, but later came to know its problem with Android Version not hardware. My phone had a few problem with in-built speaker; guess that is due to moisture(sweat) getting-in and spoiling it. But works fine at lower volume levels. Overall good phone with absolute value for money.
i AM USING IT FOR 10 DAYS AND PREVIOUSLY I USED LUMIA 520 AND GALAXY S DOUS .. BT I WANT TO SAY IT IS THE BEST...SMARTPHONE WITH DUAL SIM FRONT CAMERA.. ALL REQUIREMENT IS FULFILLED WITH FLIPKART AND SONY THE LEGEND BRAND............
Great battery life - 2 full days! Excellent connectivity options to other electronics stuff Not too big - not too small doesn't get hot even after using it continuously dual sim - dual active
Good mobile with additional NFC and more features. Just loved it. Look is stunning. Too light in weight.
I suggest if anyone purchase new cellphone under 11-13k then it was best product on this range. Everything is good
Really great phone in this cheap rate. Far better than samsung core.Its camera, design, net speed just wow. Please go for it ...
this phone is lagging and it was damaged and all the sensors were not working and it was all rubbish by the seller
XPERIA M' is way better than Core. Xperia M has much powerfull processor & gpu than Core so the performance is always better in M. M plays HD videos while Core cannot do this. Camera of M produces good vibrant and sharper images than Core. Xperia M has sharper screen than Core .UI of Xperia M is smooth and breezy while Core lags many a times. Internet speed is HSPA+ in XPERIA M which is 21mbps while laggard & slow Core has 7mbps speed. Core cannot play HD videos while Xperia M does it very well. Gaming in Core is average & 3D games forget about it, it is worst. XPERIA M plays plenty of HD GAMES, 3D GAMES & what not becoz it has powerfull Adreno 305 GPU. Xperia M looks stylish, beautifull & sturdy while Core has same old looks of its older siblings. Xperia M is what a better a phone can be in its segment. So better know more about 'Xperia M
using this product since past 3 months and havnts got and lag problem or others..i m quite satisfied with the choice of myself to go with this phone
This is a nice phone which looks slim and cute. Many low cost mobiles came in market with increased configuration than xperia m.but as a sony product it packed up with lot of features like NFC,Wifi Direct,etc,.Except camera, it attracts with it's look and feel. If you are not too concerned about camera this is really a good choice.
Well priced, Android is plus and Sony is best in multimedia be it video or audio quality.Best in mid segment Andriod phones. Flipkart offer helped us to get n awesome price.I gifted it to my pal.
very good but not excellent because not 1.3 mp secondary camera and android 4.4 kitkat buy motorola moto e in 6999/-
I bought this mobile for my sister and she is very happy with it's performance and I also used it and felt the same... I told it to my friend and he also bought the same mobile but single sim in this flipkart shopping center and he told me that it's very good... and I am v.v.v.v. happy with this flipkart because they send this items very quick and carefully and also they inform what is happening day by day... hats of to u flipkart guys..... love it...
nice product good looking working great .... battery ok .... quallity ok .... my dream came into real
works well, but getting heated up while charging and using internet. Camera is suit for scan the documents and out door photography especially long view landscapes, but performs bad in room conditions.Radio volume is too low to hear even in full volume level. loud speaker produce crackly voice in full volume level for music player and ringing tones. the rest of the features are satisfactory.. i think the best in this range of price. i recommend it for moderate level users.
Sony's Xperia range is the best! Unlike the samsung phones ,which are a bit curved at the edges, Xperia M is a bit rectangular,giving it a smart look. Just that since the memory is a bit low,you will have to purchase an additional memory card,preferably 16 GB. Overall applications are good, but as for me most of them have proved to be not much useful. The Walkman sound is the best part of this phone.The sound quality is more than awesome!! Luckily I also got free headsets with this phone ,worth Rs.1500. I don't know if the offer is still there. Lastly,it is a great phone for first-time buyers like me!!
I HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT IT PRODUCES HEAT WHILE TALKING AM NOT ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING
Nokia Lumia 520 and Xperia M has dual core processor and same GPU. But lumia can play 1080p videos smoothly, but xperia cant even attempt to play 1080p videos. I wonder why? Colors are not very vibrant in xperia M compared to lumia 520. A serious defect with Xperia M is that it has low internal storage and does not allow to move apps to SD Card. I wish if the firmware update solved this issue. But I'm not very hopeful as none of the reviews(about the update) I read so far made a mention of this facility. Camera app is very good (I mean it allows you to take pictures in different color tones, also features like kaleidoscope etc is nice). But the camera clarity sucks. It doesnt at all feel like a 5mp camera.. A serious flaw is that it has no macro shooting capability(i.e you cant focus the camera on things which are very close, say within a feet). But the flash does a good job in taking pictures at night. There is no inbuilt video calling facility. You can make video calls only through apps like Skype. Even Micromax provides inbuilt Video calling facility. It makes me extremely sad why Sony doesn't provide that. One good thing I observed (compared to my previous phone, i.e Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini Pro) is its battery life. Its decent compared to most devices available today at this price range. Another good thing is the Walkman app. Its a reasonably good music app. Equaliser is really nice. But about the external speaker, i didnt find anything gr8 as I read in many reviews, before i bought the phone. Xloud is just a "make.believe" ;-) . Without turning on Xloud option, the speaker is far below the mark. The 'one major thing' that comes for my solace is 'Andoid' OS. I just love it. Also I must admit that my Xperia M played most ordinary games in the android market (like temple run 2 etc) decently well. I couldn't try any high end games so far as i have to delete most apps to make some free space in the phone memory. Overall I find nothing extra ordinary about this phone. If sony doesn't provide the option to 'move apps to SD card' in its new update, this phone would be highly unsatisfactory.
this handset is very good mobile nice look and long battery backup and nice clarity camera 5mp with flash
Hi folks, I wanna review xperia m dual after 3months of usage. Now i sold it off and bot a lumia 720 and would like to compare both these phones and the reason why i had to get rid of xperia m purple which i loved the most. Between, i am not a geeky s/w reviewer. I want some basic functions to work well in my phone, in which xperia m highly disapointed me. Lumia 720 vs Xperia m ---------------------------------------- Interface: Both 720 n xperia m have awesome interfaces. I am very impressed with sony though, Its led notifications are something to die for. They r customizable and just awesome. You ll love its aesthetics. Even android customizations r pretty awesome. 720 has 4.3 inch display n is quite vibrant. But xperia wins here hands down. Even back finish of xperia m is so perfect that u ll jus love it while holding it. Both the phones r lightweight though. 10-15gms wont make them heavy. VERDICT : Xperia m Battery: Xperia m sucks here big time. It heats up a lot if u keep screen on for say 15mins or so when u play games or browse internet. 3G drinks battery like mad. With avg 2g usage and some music, if u start at 100% in d morning, by evening 3 or 4, u ll run out of battery. Screen-on time max is 2 n half hrs, after which battery will jus b empty. Sony power saving mode is trash. Doesn't really help. On the flipside, Lumia 720 battery is just awesome. It doesn't heat up at all with even after 1hr of video play or browsing. In simple terms, u can say that 720 battery is more than twice of xperia. Having said that, compared to other non-nokia smart phones in market, xperia m has decent battery life. VERDICT : NOKIA 200% Camera : Xperia m has terrrible camera. Worse than a VGA cam. When buying this phone, assume that u r buying a smart phone with no camera. Infact no camera is better than this sony's camera, as every pic you click with it gives more n more pain. Its jus depressing. I had to sell of sony mainly coz of this. Forget video recording 720's camera is simply the best from nokia. Its 6.7MP, but shoots more like a digicam. Its jus awesome VERDICT : Lumia.. n xperia jus pathetic here. Response : I would say both these phones have very good touch response. With xperia m at 1gb ram never lags, but windows is light making 720 also very responsive. 1 problem with xperia is, it hangs many many times after say a months of usage. U ll have to manually remove battery to restart phone. Entire display jus freezes. n It happened to me on an avg, twice a day.. sometimes even 5 6 times ! Comeon Sony.. wats this bullshit. VERDICT : Neutral OS : Android wins here. Windows simply doesn't have many commonly used apps also. For example MX player, vlc, swiftkey etc r missing. But, considering wp 8.1 update, this may improve. But, overall, android is clear winner by huge margin. Windows is far behind android in this case. VERDICT : xperia m all the way. Sims : Xperia m is dual, whereas 720 is 1gle sim Memory : xperia has 4gb, out of which only 1.7gb is avaiable to users, n more over apps can't be moved to sdcard. 720 sports 8gb, out of which abt 4.5gb is free VERDICT : NOKIA Price : 720 is some 4k higher than xperia ----------------- Final verdict ------------------ IF you love showing off good looking phone, with notifications n kool interface, dual sims and attractive UI, and android with lots of apps, Go for Xperia m. But IF you want some basic things to function perfectly as they are intended to, like Camera, Battery, Response etc., go for 720 even if it is windows. Most basic apps r available in windows too. Especially if u want good camera, go for this blindly. It jus amazing how sony failed in this segment so poorly. OVERALL, its 720 a clear winner out of these two.
When I bought this mobile,i am satisfied.But after 3 months used i am rethinking about why I bought this waste product.Because the internal memory is 4 GB but only 2 GB is available to user.In that also only 1.75 GB is for apps and games. If the free space in internal memory reaches 220 MB no app is installing or updating .It is saying an error INSUFFICIENT storage available. This is irritating me.
The Sony XPeria M Dual is a nice mobile with great look, easy to use and carry and with best features. But still it has some faults or limitations, that are: unreliable camera that some time works and some time not. When works it traces bluish pictures. And secondly, we cannot find the contacts numbers saved in internal memory when we connect the phone to PC.
The phone is good in all aspects but video calling is not that good in low light but it is decent in day light.
internal memory is low,pic quality little low but apart from it,it's good on it's class consideration of price.
the phone is awesome and really in a nice condition. it was also delivered to me earlier then expected. really loved it.
Battery life is really good, Audio no need to say as there is no comparison with Sony... Only drawback is camera is not up to the mark.
i m using ds phone since 15 days now.....n overall m pretty happy wd my purchase. I got it delivered in four days wen i was promised abt 8 days. Here is my review of this phone. Pros- 1. 1gb ram, n fully multi tasking, u can pause a running game to msg sum1 on whatsapp and then continue ur game. 2. amazing sleek design, quite stylish when compared to samsung, n light weighted. 3. walkman music.....lets u forget the outside environment, u can njoy it evn in high noise. 4. notification LED for incoming msg, cals, etc. 5. Battery is enough for medium usage and last for a day. Cons- 1. Internal memory 4gb out of which only 1.6gb available for user. 2. though ram is 1gb, but it tries to lag in some apps, not all. 3. when using 3G the phones heats up pretty fast. 4. Camera is not suited for low light snapping. 5. I have tried but could not move apps to sd card. So in my opinion, if u love sony, like me, u can safely buy this phone, its the best in its range dont bother about the money, its total paisaa vasool. it does stands out from the crowd, n u would love to own it..
very user friendly.. browsing speed.. good looks.. display is good, no lag.. cam nt that great..audio is low, bt good.
First of all let take the opportunity to give a salute to Flipkart team.. you guys are awesome!! Thanks a ton for your support..... I have used Galaxy Core (for 15 days) and Experia M too... Experia M is far far better that Core. I am using M since last 5 months and believe me its really good one. Galaxy Core.. Display- 9/10 User Interface 9/10 Performance 4/10 build quality 6/10 Camera 9/10 Sound 6/10 battery backup 4/10 (1 day maximum days for normal users) HD VDO playback 0/10 (Not supported). Experia M... Display- 8/10 User Interface 8/10 Performance 10/10 build quality 10/10 Camera 7/10 Sound 10/10 battary backup 9/10 (1.5 days for normal users) HD VDO playback 9/10. Only Problem I noticed with M is Internal memory (1.6 GBs) and Function Keys are there at display which is making the display size little smaller (not at the time of video playback) .﻿
I am using this phone since last 3 month. Well my experience till now is average the reason for this average review is that display and camera is not so good as other phone at this range. However music is awesome also it gets frequent updates for music and video apps. It can nicely play high resolution videos. My suggesion if u like small screen phone with great hardware specs than go for it also its from Great brand. Perfect for music lover.
Phone is good but camera and video quality is very poor. It has 5 mp camera but its like lesser than 2 mp of samsung.
It allow both SIM cards to be on standby waiting for a call/data connection. When a call/data is established on one SIM card, the other is no longer active. This is not Dual SIM Dual Active (DSDA) type !!! pro: NFC ENABLED and others available in other reviews cons 5 MB camera is not upto mark
I am totally stratified with the XPeria M and brilliant delivery by the flipkart.. I received this product within 4 days, I didnt have any issue till now
Its a good mobile within a medium price. I like it ... I got the product within the expected time. Camera quality and memory should be enhanced little more otherwise its a good product.
I bought this product on 4th Dec 2013 and have been using it till date. Till now I haven't come across any reason for why you should not opt for this phone. It has excellent sound clarity, good camera easy to use interface which can be personalized as per my need. Enough memory to store apps. Only disadvantage is that it gets sort of heated up after doing net or playing games for a long time. Apart from that I think it is a great buy. I love the Purple colour especially... So if you are searching for a budget phone under 14k with dual sim support then I think you should go for it.
i want to say that this is the one of the best and awesome smartphone from the house of sony. the perfect alternative for moto g
Very good like quick delivery got what paid on, nice offer, like it very much will shop often good way to get things at nice price.
GOOD BUT PRICE IS HIGH FOR THIS FACILITY...................................................................... CAMERA IS GOOD BUT MAIN PROBLEM INTERNAL MEMORY APPROX 2 GB USABLE
It is good option at this cost. I am using this for past five months . Fully satisfied with the product.
Draw Back Is 5 MP Camera Not Produce Good Result & Battery Back Up..... Over All It Is Good. Thank You Flipkart For Your Service
Average performance and the data signal drops frequently.Battery charge goes down very fast. Over all it is an average phone in this price range.
I bought this mobile with freebies portable charger, platronics Bluetooth headset and 15% cashback offer. Grabbed offer on last day. Timely delivery. Mobile is good working fine as of now.
Hi guys, I have been using this phone for the last 6 months. Many have spoken about the pros of the phone.. I will tell you about the cons. 1) Network loss in SIM1 if i switch on the internet in SIM2. ( for this issue i have observed that, if we are using 2G in SIM1 and 3G in SIM2, there is no network loss and the phone works fine, but, if you use, 3G in SIM1 and 2G in SIM2 and switch the internet on, there is n/w loss in SIM1). 2) Cannot move apps to SD card. What is the use of the fast processor and 1GB RAM and graphic card. Huge games cannot be installed. 3) Camera is at its worst. Not expected from Sony. Colours are very unnatural and the images are grainy. 4) During the video recording, auto focusing is a big issue. Videos tend to get blurred when you move your hand even a bit and focusing back to the clear image takes some time. 5) The radio app from Sony is also not good/ not user friendly. 6) Battery drains out very quickly. 7) Phone gets heated up after moderate 3G use/playing games (after 10 -15 mins of usage). 8) It is not a dual stand by phone. When you are call on SIM1, SIM2 is disabled and vice versa. 9) 3G n/w is available on only one sim at a time. (You can either set it on SIM1 or SIM2, acc to your requirement). When you set 1one of sim in 3G mode, the other automatically sets itself into 2G mode.
It is a good phone within this range. Video quality is awesome. Sound is also as SONY brand. I like it.
All about Phone is good! Nice features with new improved Android Jelly bean OS, and good end configurations makes my works simple. Negative points: As i experienced Cam quality is just 'Ok' instead of "Good".. so no much quality..especially front cam.. Sound and display, music,etc. are good. As battery powered with 1750mAh, but it is running only 1.5 days ( based on my usage) but on standby it would be better. nice design in viewing screen in normal mode and Locked mode. sony done Good job. Tq.
I ordered this mobile for my friend on his request and I had used it for a week. The quality of mobile in all aspect was the best mentioned. Camera, in-built apps and software customization was made perfect and has quick response.
I wanna to buy m dual. its beautiful look attract to every one .functions are easy to operate. I always tell quality is quality .sony is famous brand and reputed company.but there is one thing which makes it fake there are no more service center. All over sony is best for me.
•﹏•★•﹏• I am using Sony m dual. For. Last 5months and all I can Say that its nothing more than average. And in ere of smartphones with tough compitition there is no place 4 average cells , so m dual has to b satisfied with 3/5. You will be forgiven if you say its just an another android device.Specs are almost same of Sony m and m dual,except m dual has 4.2.2 android but m runs on 4.1 jelly bean, m dual can get a 4.3 update in near future. you will get roughly mere 1.3 gb usable internal space Out of 4 gb flash (though if u check it will say 2.03 gb total but will not b available for user, rest will b occupied by os n others) there will b some useless app preinstalled, U can uninstall them but they will not free up ur internal space, if u factory restore ur fone they will come back, i ve restored 3 times in 5 mnths, so better not 2 uninstall those apps(e.g. app xtra, foneclay, mcfree av, track id, evernote etc). low internal space is actually pathetic n main drawback , u must root 2 use it. Fortunately there is a workin n very easy method available 4 rootin dis cell. Now comin 2 ram it gets 804mb of ram Out of 1 gb to b used as rest will b occupied by the os. Msm 8227 s4 plus (krait) 1 ghz dual core CPU is average, but gpu is adreno305 which is amazing.it will support all games but you can't play them for lack of internal space.overall camera is very poor it doesn't takes pics like a 5mp, pictures are all blue n noisy in low light not great in daylight as well, d r a bit muddy With hdr on it takes years to take pic n pic looks like someone polished cream on it(When hdr is on) lol but its true. it records n supports720p hd video. Screen is crisp. But colors are not that vibrant. sub per viewing angle is poor.Battery is 1750mah l-ion its good lasts 7 hrs. Of heavy usage n if u r a moderate user it will last 1 day with stamina mode on. i didnt find walkman sound any great.we will not get sony playstation app available in india, in my phone sony select app is not working at all. sony keyboard is dull with auto correct and the letters are very congested that will make prone to make a lot of of mistakes i m using it for now 5 mnths still i m not accustomed 2 it. i m also writting this via my m dual keepin auto correct off. multitasking and ui is superb n smooth u can do a lot of things at d same time minimising ur current work. but multi window is not like grand or grand 2 u cant c video doin another work in same time. wifi speed is good but with 2g it some time did not connect to data. earlier i used nokia 311 that used to give 30-40 kbps 2G speed but this phone will not give u more than 20kbps on 2G ever, it happens 4the sake of low SAR value, keep in mind that sar value will b under 1.60 in every cell but closer to1.6 will produce better connectivity but there is no issue with 3G connectivity. now if we check antutu benchmark we can c my m dual scored 11500 n a google search told me sony l, sam core scored respectively ~12000 n 10500, while moto g scores 17300 which is better than google nexus 4 , yeah its true u cn check it. its hard to suggest Sony m or m dual ahead of sony l or moto g... prices are : Sony m :-11300, m dual:12300, Sony l: 14300. Samsung core 12100, motorola moto g 16 gb: 14000.....but m or m dual certainly a stylish budget phone with cool looks, its slim n light only 115 gm, its a looker, dont go with white color as white doesnt suit xperia , purple is most sexy n best suited, purple is not for only girls ok!!!.... but Best budget phone now in the market is certainly Motorola Moto g 16gb........main problem in m or m dual is lack of internal space n camera quality, but cell hw and build in quality is not that great not that poor either..i will Give these marks 2 m dual.....Os: 8/10, battery 8/10, internal space: 1/10 (u must root ur fone 2 fix dat, there is a very easy method available for dis cell 2 be rooted , a google search may pull out all about dis issue), ram: 7/10, cpu: 6/10, rear cam: 4/10, music: 7/10, screen: 7/10, looks: 9/10, gpu: 9/10, led notification 10/10
this mobile is work very fast but mobile is using 10-15 min its back side side is heatead......................................................................................................................................................................................
Not good. Phone needs update. Cant be done by self. Play store is not opening Need to go to service center.
So far so good. No issues and product is awesome. Delivered on time, service is good. Only improvement, though for Sony, not for flippy, internal memory should have been more. 2GB is so nano.
I recently bought this mobile and i am really happy with it. The performance is cool and on the whole i recommend this mobile.
Sony Xperia M Dual , The product was good my personal experience ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
good features for the price.. stylish , good quality build. good camera ,nice music on the go. good screen.
I brought it for my spouse who had a experience of using Xperia U before. Performance and web browsing is really cool. oops !! no bravia engine which availed in Xperia U. Camera quality is really poor. I'm giving 3 star bcoz of design and the brand value..
look - Great look of all sony product display- awesome display. with styles i also used sony xperia J . but this 1 is new and good because its 1GB ram so feeling good after using this phone.. as compare to camera sony J's result is better then sony M. Music- Awesome sound :) 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro, Dual Core and android jelly bean :) !1gb ram is plus point.! over all phone is good for under 13 k. i got this product from flipkart with discount offer :) thanks u :) . must buy this phone. :) even work fine with dual sim ..!
Guys M using the phone for last 2 months and my exp is great. Looks is the charm of the phone, No lag. If u want a good phone in 12 K its the best I can say. :-)
I have purchased more than 100 mobiles but Sony Xperia M is excellent, speed & Sound is Excellent. comparision to Sony Xperia C I have purchased more than 100 mobiles but Sony Xperia M is excellent, speed & Sound is Excellent. comparision to Sony Xperia C
Good mobile, touch is superb, display is awesome but battery, internal storage and camera is not sufficient. mobile is too fast. overall good.
I have ordered this phone two month's back. Now I am writing this review, I am very much satisfied with the product. Sony is know for it's quality products and this phone is not exception. As I was concerned the only flaw in this phone is camera quality apart from this every this if fine. You can open two or more apps simultaneously and can perform the multi tasking operations very smoothly there will not be any time delay. Pros: 1. Latest Android Jelly bean OS 2. Sony music player(This is good compared to other other android music players available in the play store) 3. Can share the content on other sony devices like Bravia tv etc 4. Compact design and stylish look Cons: 1. Camera quality(In daytime it produces good quality images, only problem is in night time)
This phone has no lag on playing games.......you name it...!!! It can play it......:-) Battery life can be increased by adding battery doctor or by keeping less applications. Awesome sound quality ..... Sony always cares for it. It can only play 720p videos... Overall a best buy for this price. Go for it .... If u r a person who wish to carry a big phone, then go for SONY XPERIA M2.......
How come Sony's low end mobile costing 12k has lesser lag than Galaxy S4. And the speaker volume is twice as high as my iPhone's. Go for it, best in its class.
Good for the money. Even say the at that price. I can fell lot of radiation, may be due to dual sim i guess.i have issue in changing the message center numbers in sony phones. Internal memory little low but who use it purposefully and not for game, it is good.
Camera Quality is not as expected. Others are good as compared to the price and other available models in the same range. Giving it a 4 rating because of only poor quality of camera module.
What's the use of 1GB RAM and Adreno 305 if the internal memory is less than 2GB? Otherwise this is one hell of a phone.
adereno 303 1 gb ram these features are getting in average cost. Its really good. Generally Sony wont provide this much features in cheap cost but this model is awesome. Phone is having good resolution, good pixel density, also camera quality is remarkable. Slim look enhances its look.
At first thanks to flipkart for it's fast delivery. I got this product within 3days from the date of order. I am always a SONY fan. In low budget around 10-12K my search end with this XPERIA M dual from SONY. Here are some Review from my site - Pros:- -------- 1> Stylish slick design. 2> Screen quality is ok, Navigation UI is very good and smooth. 3> Awesome video quality. when u try to put any .avi or .wmv video in it, it automatically converts to the .mp4. 4> Music quality also good. 5> Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, 1GHz Qualcomm S4 Plus dual-core CPU and 1GB RAM. 6> Wifi reception is very decent also wifi hotspot. 7> Game is running smoothly. Trying - Temple Run 1&2, Subway Surf, Dead Triggers 1&2, Angry Birds. 8> Internal speaker is very good. Cons:- ------------- 1> Out of 4GB only 2.1 Gb will be available for the user application and all. other 2Gb is occupied by the firmware and OS.As a result u will not able to play any big file, game etc. 2> 5mp camera is not so decent, this is not expected from SONY. 3> Ear phone is good not gr8 (not expected from sony) 4> No APPS to SD facility is available for this phone. Memory expansion will helpful for media only.
I purchase xperia m dual one week ago from flipkart, its an stylish phone. As in the specification mentioned Dual SIM will be in ACTIVE but it is not active while you are in Call. Means that whenever you are making or receiving a call for SIM 1 the other SIM will go in to INACTIVE (Out of Network) mode. you will not receive call for SIM 2 and the dialler end will receive message out of network area. Except those issue its fine.
I can say this is good product I found in less money . everything is good except battery ..battery getting discharge not so frequent but it's bit early what I thought.
after one month use...its preety gud...but xpected fab camera quality....but d camera is very poor..n flipkart shows..4 gb internal memory...but d internal memory...is quite...less..its jus 2 gb..d fone keeps on hanging..if d internal memory gets full...not comparing but...der r many fones below 10 k wd 4 gb internal memory...over all its a gud prety fones for gals(d purple color)..
nice phone, good battery backup (runs a full day and more with normal usage), fast and lagfree system.. jus loving it... Fast delivery from Flipkart... Thank you! I would recommend this product with such price.. go ahead!
Phone is good, nice built, screen quality is crisp and clear, touch is really good, tons of features. A nice phone with a good price. Sound quality is magnificient. The only drawback is internal memory which is 4 GB and 2GB is reserved foe OS, Camera is a little low. Overall quality product. Anyone who wants a feature treat buy it.
it is a great phone with this price range. Also you are getting the brand value of SONY,service center are plently available.You will also get so many XDA developments for this phone. I am using this phone for about a month and still there no issue.It can also play HD games like MC4, Dead Trigger HD etc very fluently.It is packed with qualcomm snapdragon S4(dual core) with adreno 305 while is better in performance for any other quadcore processsor giving brand with this price range. So DON'T THINK ABOUT ANY 2nd OPTION WHILE BUYING THIS PHONE.
Nice phone at awesome prince with super fast delivery...cool transaction I have purchased many products from flipkart which are sold by WS retails.All product are of best quality and rocket delivery
Its almost 1 year, so its right time to review this product - Pros - 1. Good touch screen, very smooth. 2. Even with 5mp camera, the pics are pretty good. But lacks quality in poor light (flash may help some time). 3.Good part is no-hickup/hangs... :-) 4. TempleRun etc. games run seamlessly. 5. Auto update feature of OS is good, but may sometime consume lots of Data (its individual choice to keep it On/Off). Last & Final release 4.3 no more 5.0. 6.Very handy, nice grip. Cons - 1. Now a days using MotoG. As compared to MotoG, this is a dumb phone. The WiFi disconnects frequently, when you move from one zone to another. 2. Sometime its goes to other mobile networks, I dont know why? Its a dumb phone! 3. Has 1GB RAM, but for user its only 500mb or less left. Should have atleast 2GB. 4. Major disadvantage I find is, it does not support installing Apps on Memory Card. Even the AppMgrIII does not help me out! Suggestion is to go for MotoG./Xiaomi etc.
Bought it on 2nd Feb 2014. An excellent phone from sony. Surely the best dual Sim phone at this price point. Compact yet powerful. Perfect CPU, adequate RAM and a high speed modem made it a perfect weapon of choice. dont even think about Moto G or galaxy core. perfect for every day use if you need a compact phone with great performance, using internet on the phone and share it well nothing is better than this. Few drawbacks obviously the internal storage isnt sufficient as per the modern android apps demand. Battery is not up to the mark as it should be. Heavy usage can give you only half a day or a little more than that. Makes an urge for a power bank. Camera is not good enough as a minimum expectation from a sony phone. On screen home button i am not used to.Neither like it at all. But still Samsung has a lot to learn from this one.
No HD video playback support Poor battery backup Definitely this phone is not suitable for gamers and net users. Overall this phone is not performing as per its specification (like china phone), I have personally tested this phone, trust me.
Too good ! Fantastic delivery terms ! Packaging was superb. Product was bubble wrapped, safely. Recommended seller. SUPEREBBBBBBBBBBBBB You bought Sony Xperia M Dual
I have purchase xperia m dual from flipkart good delivery. Xperia M good quality con is apps not install in sd card all apps install in phone memory so it's big pro. you can't install big games on it. not sufficient space in internal memory.
it needs some more security,it needs some more important apps. sony service centres are also to be increased globally
the phone is working great, but sometimes it is heating up with a few minutes usage of internet. otherwise it is very slim and good looking phone
its so good experience to use this model.it has good touch and processor is work fast then samsung phone. it has good internal memory and the camera result is very nice.
Best Smartphone ever in mid Range.. Lots of extra feature compare to samsung and other android phones very very nice phone i swear..friends
It is really awesome mobile for the middle budget people.. Really no words abt the mobile is really rocking in my hand.. Thanks to flipkart for the fast delivery..
I'm using this product for 3 months .... pros. Smoth, Fast as it have 1GB Ram, Krait dual cpu, Adreno 305 GPU... Lag free . it hasn't hanged to me yet . . . 720p Video Support ..

NO BRAVIA ENGINE Overall i'm pretty Satisfied .. . .
Phone is superb at this price range except the camera. Doesn't hangs, it is far ahead of samsung worst phones that hangs frequently.
Flupkart service is very good.. Phone is pretty good except. That the battery is not the most efficient. I have orderd a ncase flip cover along with it.. And that was the worst part, the cover is not at all good..
I got mobile in a good condition from flipkart. I am using it from 20 days, its performance is good. It is the good configuration at this price
Original info: 2gb memory(1gb use by sony, 1gb free) 800 mb ram(425 mb use by system, 375 free for user) all bakvas app given by sony, files browsing is not user friendly compare to samsung, nokia app not install on sd card, bluetooth, flash transfer file not direct put on sd card, for that u have to cut files form internal memory to sd card at every time, front camera is so bad, even you never want to open again, and rear camera not as good as samsung 3 mp camera, speaker volume is very low, fm speaker volume is very third class and its good soung only in eyerphone.... finaly very very very bad.... oh my god,,,why i m not buy canvas hd or doodle 2 for same price or some more price...
It was awesome phone in this range when I bought it. Touch, Camera, Sound are very good. Display is also good.
As a Dual Phone, its quite good and impressive. Never tried for Multimedia Apps. Battery is Good. No lagging.
I bought this cell for my mom, who is a first time touch screen and android user. At first the features seemed difficult to use, them being very different form general Nokia or Samsung ones. but the display is outstanding, so is the sound quality. In my samsung phone I had to install a sound enhancer but here the normal volume is good enough. Also the contrast in screens allows reading without hurting the eye. The camera is also really good. Battery back up is also quite fine. Definitely a product worth buying.
Camera not good. Good Sound. Some time slow. Only four GB memory.Already so many installed Apps. Unable to install some games. But overall good product.
About the flip kart it is the best option for buying a product from this site.This site gives the delivery as early as possible and that I liked much so i will give 5 stars for the site. And about the product The Sony Xperia M Dual is good phone. The clarity of the phone is very good that i liked much.The other thing is that i am not much satisfied with the internal memory of phone.But the features of the phone is good and for games,videos and other application too.So over all about the product is nice phone and i give 4 stars for the product.
Pros: - No Lag - Faster Internet browsing - Dual SIM (micro) - Long Battery backup (comes to around 1 and half day with nominal usage, 6 hours of talktime, 3 hours of browsing and rest light.) - Look and feel is good, very slim and looks good. - NFC is an added advantage Cons: -Less internal memory (I didn't find anything uncomfortable, it was fine and sufficient for me) - Camera is not upto the mark in dull lighting (Good in Daylight) I hope the Pros are more than the cons which make this phone a good-buy.
This phone meets all the expectations of a mid range buyer. The only problem of this phone is battery.
Great phone with great features. Notifications appear in the form of LED display so that you dont have to go and unlock the phone each time to check whether any Missed calls,messages are available. Video clarity is good. One feature it was missing is alarm wont ring when phone is swithced off.
Very quick delivery of a very good phone at very less prize. Phone has very intelligent interface with premium features. I don't think any other brand can give these features at this prize.
nice phone in small budget, go for it , thanful to sony for giving such awesome smartphone in such prize also to flipkart
I purchased the dual M , and felt pride that iam using sony when you think sony then its means your searching some thing beyond and ultimate reliable & stunning. video quality is very low extremely disappointing / camera and its new sensor regrets you badly even its bad then S duos the 9500 hand set from Samsung . eats much space when you shoot video or take a snap thats make a big hassle to share or send the files even sucks ur time , bandwidth and money & irritates you as bonus. Head set in very cheap & plasticity , display is very bad, viewing angle are bad , even its sony but its nothing special and overpricing the product, quality is also very bad, else in general use its ok , and working fine but Samsung is making better fones than sony quality wise & price wise go for samsung core its good if core is 100 than sony is 60. Sony is nothing like Sony ...disappointed with the quality of fone at this premium price.in Sony you pay on premium but u get the worthless quality, they overprice just on their name. But flipkart is owesome its 10/10. Great
Screen size small as compared to samsung, micromax, etc in the same range. but colors are bright and build quality is better than samsung's phone in the same range. Never hangs... since 1 GB RAM, But i am using ram cleaner software. I think it is time to dump all sub-1GB RAM phones. (soon it will be time to dump even those with 1 GB RAM in favour of those with atleast 2GB) Since screen is 4", Fits easily in pent pockets and can be handled easily with one hand.
The phone is really light to carry and looks awesome. Easy to use with Android Jelly bean. Only draw back I find is we cannot move applications to SD card which should not be limited by Sony. Apart from this I would say the phone is really good at such a low price.
Phone is fantastic ... a couple months now , smooth as anything. Only issue is volume ... really low ... both ringing and music volumes. Hope sony updates their firmware soon to fix this.
All the features are really good except the camera. Images are soft and not sharp. Definitely this was not expected form a 5MP camera. Usable In build memory is around 1GB. Touch is really amazing and its pretty stylish mobile too.
excellent mobile...... excellent features..... excellent loock..... excellent battery excellent earphone sound..... excellent price........ excellent everything in sony xperia m..................realy awesome dosto....
I have good experience with Sony Xperia M. It is a very fast processor, good sound, good looking features and good touch. This time with Xeria M Am fully satisfied.
FlipKart Delivery was in Time. Nice phone. Worth for Price, Battery:Good At rare I feel Lag in Touch.. Otherwise good.
The phone is worth for its price in this range. The processing speed is good, Screen is sufficiently large, Camera is good, Touch Performance is smooth. One of the best feature of this phone is the Battery saving mode. For normal use with Wi-Fi the Battery discharges in 1 to 2 days. Apart from this the phone is also loaded with some typical SONY functions and Applications. One can purchase this phone if he/she is lover of SONY and want fast and smooth performance.
Look,Price and Speed are just awesome with the best configuration at this rate and a named Brand... Camera has got a bit compromising performance,but thats fine as i used the mobile basically for conversations.
Its a good phone with all the required features & functions for a normal Android phone user. Delivery by Flikart was good, can track the status online & prompt delivery @ my residence.
So extra ordinary mobile in comparison to samsung etc.... i m lovn't .battery backup is much better than other android phones
I am confused between xperia M dual or xperia L... help me out looking or dual sim xperia M but i think camera is not stand 5Mp or another problem is app not transfer to sd. or other hand L camera great but looking or it is not dual sim. who is the best my old xperia U is lost.
Sony name is enough for quality of product. Xperia M dual proves its very good & Good camera quality. Battery 10/8 Camera 10/9
I have been using this product 4 abt 1 mnth nd i just wanna discribe it in 1 wrd,"MINDBLOWING". I have also been using samsung bt compard 2 tat sony s providng excellnt product 4 a reasonabl price.Just enjoying every single moment with ma new friend.. ;) :p ..The nly con tat i found was, internal memry s givn as 4 gb but the available spce s just abt 1.9 gb aftr all apps r preinstald in it..So 4 peopl who stre in mry card mre,u can perfectly go to tis super hero.. ;) Nd ofcrse delivry by flipkrt s alwys excellent... ;) (Y)
Phone is too good. the best mobile for this budget........ better to have dual than single.. no problem in dual.. Flipkart service is good,,....
I bought this mobile in a dilemma but to be honest my choice didn't go in vain. This is an absolute smart phone within the 15K budget. Although the specification says that the rear camera is 5MP its way better than that. After getting a Sony smart phone how will I forget to mention about music quality. Yes, its really wonderful. Overall I would say this is an user friendly phone.
The phone is worth for its price in this range. The processing speed is good, Screen is sufficiently large, Camera is good, Touch Performance is smooth. One of the best feature of this phone is the Battery saving mode. For normal use with Wi-Fi the Battery discharges in 1 to 2 days. Apart from this the phone is also loaded with some typical SONY functions and Applications. One can purchase this phone if he/she is lover of SONY and want fast and smooth performance.
Sony Xperia M dual is best choice if u r looking for a smrtphone in the range of rs 15000, Its look,touch and battery backup is very impressive. Some people were saying camera is not upto the mark but it is ok as it is 5MP . Its size is compact,so it is very easy to use using a single hand. Features are definately Impressive. Overall I am very happy with Sony Xperia M dual specially with white colour.
Flipkart:- Items Delivery in one Day is very good. I am writing this review after 27 Days of use. Overall I am very satisfy with performance of this phone. 1. Camera Clarity is not up to the mark 2. Only 2GB available for end user 3. You cannot install and move applications to SD Card 4. Only one sim will be active during call for example: if you are calling from Sim 1 then Sim 2 will be out of coverage area.
I was bored of seeing Samsung mobile with everyone and Samsung has the same design/looks for all the models starting from 5k to 50k and no one will know the cost of it. so i wished to go for Sony. Initially had problem using it, but now i enjoy it.. its very nice and good one.. i love it.. one can just go for it.. it has amazing looks and easy to operate... i love this phone...
Xperia M dual is good when compared to same range Samsung mobiles Pros * Display * Sound * Battery * Speed Cons * Low pixel front cam * Only 2 GB internal memory available * Micro SIM + Micro SIM
I am writing this review after 1 week of use. Overall I am very satisfy with performance of this phone. Pros: 1. The screen resolution is good at this price range. 2. Good GPU precessing, No lagging. 3. 4" screen is good for single handed operations. 4. Sony widgets enables quick access of some important controls apps. 5. Battery lasted for more than 1 day of mixed use. I like the Battery Stamina mode of this phone. 6. It supports dual standby to handle 2 SIM cads simultaneously. 7. The phone supports NFC. 8. USB OTG support. I am amazed to have this feature on this phone. I can use my pen drive directly and also able to connect my Logitech MK270 Wireless combo with this phone. Cons: Sony could have improve the camera quality of this phone, but It's fine at this price tag.
Hi I am fequently products buye from flipkart. On 16th Jan I bought this Xperia M Dual. As every mobiles have prons and cons this mobile also not apart from its Cons. Please be aware of below cons of this Xperia M Dual mobile. Hope this will help new buyer. 1. Camera Clarity is not upto the mark 2. Only 2GB available for enduser 3. You cannot install and move applications to SD Card 4. Only one sim will be active during call for example: if you are caling from Sim 1 then Sim 2 will be out of coverage area.
When my phone got lost ( Sony Ericcsson), I though i should say goodbye to chances of having a good Sony Phone but was presently surprised by the specs and price point of this gem. Apart from a slightly dull display, this phone is amazing in performance and quality is good compared to other Korean/Taiwanese counterparts. It is a Sony and that is enough reason to get the phone at this price point.
Once again Flipkart showed its fast delivery Pros: A good customized apps, no need to download any app in play store...... all are in pre-installed. Good battery backup.... Cons: Network issues sometime.. but thats' not an issue
I PURCHASED SONY EXPERIA M DUAL BLACK RECENTLY. ITS A GREAT PIECE FROM SONY WITH REASONABLE PRICE. I PURCHASED THRU FLIPKART. IT IS DELIVERED IN ONLY 3 DAYS. THE SERVICES FROM FLIPKART IS REALLY GREAT AND THEY ARE DOING A SPLENDID SERVICES. KEEP IT UP.
The set is good to handle but it is having less internal memory. Its Charger is also of very short length.
Sony Xperia M Dual is Good one , but sometimes voice problem may occurs may network problem or other , my voice not reached clearly at other end.
i got this from flipkart at lowest price possible 12906/- and am happy with that... coming to pro's 1) build quality and sleekness impressed me. 2) the processor will allow me to use mobile at a great speed with only 150mb user memory left free, the home button will bring u to home screen with more than 5apps running. 3) the camera capyures good images bt adds colours making it beautiful but nt natural! though u'll be happy seeing the pictures, u cant get natural one's. con's 1) battery backup is low , without using any power saving tools and having net and gaming on the battery hardly lasts 7hrs, but with power saving tools and normal usage it is like any other smart phone which lasts for a day and lil more. 2) biggest drawback is with internal memory which is just 2GB available for user and sony hasn't updated to save apps to sd which will restrict ur app usage! i am happy with is phone except user available internal memory and if sony updates app savings to sd in next android version it will be the best phone in the range
Flipkart : I will recommend everyone because of perfect delivery of items with quality and process. Sony Experia M Dual : I have been using this phone for past 1 & half months, I will list down the +/- Plus (+) : 1. Handy 2. Good Design 3. Good screen clarity, video, photos 4. Good Sound Minus(-) : 1. Camera 5MP not up to the mark but it's okay. 2. Battery discharging quickly but its manageable. 3. When you try messaging to list of peoples, after selecting the peoples(e.g a,b,c,d,e,f) it will show as "a, and 5more". If we click 5more it should display the other peoples like b,c,d,e,f in "To". But for first time when you click it's not showing the remaining peoples it will consider the "and 5 more" as one contact so we are not able to send message and if you again select peoples and click "and 5 more" it will show the remaining peoples then you can able to send message to all peoples. 4. You cannot move applications to SD card after installation. 5. Internal memory is less for game lovers. Overall : I will recommend this phone because the minus(-) which I have listed above are manageable.
If you r fascinated about your mobile and have not so high budget then go for Xperia M . It comes with Android version 4.2.2 i.e Jelly Beans . The Power Manage option is too good which shows you the estimate stand by time and comes with 3 power saving option which is really useful . The main thing I dont like is that its come with 4 gb internal memory in which 2 gb usable and you cant transfer your apps to the SD card even with third party app also. Talking about display the screen fade slightly if you tilt the phone in every axis, overall display is fabulous plus it has auto brightness option which is much worthy and it doesn't have any shortcut option for Auto Rotate Screen . Sound quality of this handset is too good for its Clear Phase and xLOUD option in addition . But Radio speaker volume is low . What new I got is that this set is NFC compatibility option . Coming to camera , if you want to take god quality snaps with this phone then think twice . In case of connective and data transfer , its good . In a nutshell : Value for money : 4/5 User Friendly : 4.5/5 Memory : 2.5/5 Battery : 4/5 Apps : 4/5. Go for Xperia M or Xperia M Dual .
Excellent mobile set below 15000 range with great features. I would like to recommend it to my friends..If its had a big battery its will be a topper in its segment...Camera Superb, Touch works smoothly n internet works up to the expectation even in rural areas where we dont hav 3G....
Please be ready with Micro SIM because this handset supports only Micro SIMs. on a scale of 10 Super Sexy n Slim Handset (10/10) Display and touch response is brilliant (10/10) Sound clarity is good. Bass Boost option is there for bass lovers & lot of other sound enhancement. Loudness is bit less may be Sony is not giving it purposely (7/10) This handset is packed with 1 GHz Dual Core processor. This is not at all disappoint game lovers (10/10) Camera quality is not that impressive as per my expectation (5/10) Overall...very good handset with all required specs Jelly Bean OS, 4 inc screen, Dual Sim, Front & Back Camera, 1GHZ Dual core processor, 1 GB RAM & 245 ppi. What else we want from a premium brand at this price.
VERY GOOD PHONE FOR THE MONEY. WORTH IT'S PRICE. I GOT THIS PHONE AT THE CHEAPEST RATE IN FLIPKART.IT IS VERY LIGHT AND HANDY PHONE.
Sony Xperia M Dual, does not lag at all under normal use. Music is great but in-the-box pair of earphones below par the legacy of Sony. Overall the best buy at this price. Flipkart, very very slow delivery.
Slipped down the hand & broke. Service centre said the warranty is void. INR 2250/- for body + 500 (Service Charge). Really unhappy with so called a branded mobile. Submitted the phone at the service centre a fortnight ago & they're saying that the part needs to be imported & hasn't reached India yet.
I'm satisfied with Sony Xperia features, Would request to increase the internal memory for the same. Internal Memory should be atleast 16GB minimum. External memory to be made upto 64 GB. All other features are good.
I ordered this product with "in a day delivery".... and next day i got it... thanks flipkart for superfast delivery.... I bought this mobile with belief that, Sony is the best brand and for sure they will not give creepy products for sure. And worked well for me. About the Experia M, look wise it is the best, processing speed is also fast. Gaming experience is pretty good. In short I love my Experia M.
A good, quality product.. I am very happy with this & till date there is no problem, nice maps, google +, all working nicely.. also net speed is good.
more powerful and less price. best part is adreno 320 gpu processor and 1gb ram. buy it if you are looking for 4.0".
I have been using Xperia-M since last one month. the phone touch is very smooth. Speed is extremely good.Phone has a very classy look and camera quality is OK. I have used Samsung galxy S duos and would recommend Xperia-M anytime over it.
I got this phone only in 1.5 days... Service is really so fast... Mobile has good brandy look...and as per its size its handy.... As I say- Its a perfect smartphone.. Which has not more but many things that make u to love it.... Thanks to Flipkart...- Dhiraj Jadhav..
Pos - it is very good phone in this range,it's very light weight and it's looks very good,music and sound clarity is also good Nag - camera is average, usable internal memory only 2 gb its problem and i think its battery create problem for smart user,
This phone is not a bad phone neither a great phone. Has Very slim body Very light weight Great screen quality Average screen size Good battery backup (need to check with dual sim) Above average sound output No pre installed games from sony Many un useful pre-installed apps Above Average response of apps Memory is just enough for apps Average camera with blue tint. Not great cost to value ratio as we get better specs than this for the same price. Thats all I can say.
Camera not good.... Applications can't install in sd card All other features are good........ Dual sim facility is also good......
I like this phone and its performance...this phone has great processor Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 pro dual core....
sony xperia m dual..good phone in this price range...flipkart delivery also good.. Anyways..its definitely worth buying in this price range..Go for it!!
I gifted this phone to my wife. She made a switch over from resistive touch Nokia to the sleek interface of Android. Plus I got a good deal on flipkart.
advantage: compact, less weight, etc. disadvantage: Battery support time, when we use the phone at wifi device also heated up.
I purchased this one after lots of research online and market feedback. The product is a really nice one and I am fully satisfied with the phone's performance. Flipkart delivered it within 3 working days which is very good. I received this one as mentioned in the Sony Site and with factory seal. The purple color was my choice and it looks quite nice with a rubberized back. The volume and power keys are very firm and sturdy. The build quality of the phone is very good. It is a slim and light product from Sony. The sound quality is excellent as expected by Sony. Camera is good if not the best in this range. Battery performance is quite good with daily usage. Earphones are not in-ear which as a disappointment however the sound quality is great. There is no lag what-so-ever while doing processor intensive tasks. There is no free screen-guard on the box. The best thing was I got this one at a far less price than what is selling on the shops. Must buy who are planning to buy this one. You will not get a performance phone in this price range.
I have been using the phone since a month now after ordering from Flipkart and so far the phone has met all the expectations I had about. The only thing I did not like is that the dual SIM are microSIM which is not mentioned in the specification of the phone in Flipkart site.
when i purchased this mobile i received a defective one but thanks to flipkart they replaced as per their promise to customers on their website, and this mobile is upto my satisfactions everything is good,nice design and good sound quality.the only problem im facing is battery is getting drain very quickly,otherwise a very nice phone,i think it might a battery problem of my set only.the previous handset i received was a defective one but the battery backup is very good,but this new handset as a replacement that i received is everything good only battery getting low very quickly.
I have purchased the Sony Experia M dual. Amazing delivery fromn flipcart.I am not expecting, that much fast will getting the my product. Sound 10/10 camera 6.5/10 If we are playing games and will connect the wifi ,it will be little bit heated my hand set.otherwise it is gud product. Thanks Eangovan
guys this phone is best the reason iam saying is it has an minimum of 200mbs of free ram if u do no close many and by playing apps like hundreds of games at once the only 1 problem is the free memory of phone is to use is just 2.01 gb and guys thats good for this price and guys mainly for camera that is superb amazing that has exmor r sensor and nothing to say about it all is amazing
Very attractive and user friendly., Battery and camera performance are not as expected. Calls to the other number, during a call, is not working. I tried this option with call forwading option.
I have purchase this mobile there, flipkart service is excellent!!! Xperia M is a good smart phone, but camera & battery backup is very poor!!!!!
Good Flipkart Service.... wish to keep it continue... Sony Xperia M Dual is good one for the price, except the internal storage limitation with no option to move an application to SD Card and the poor Camera quality in dark light / night time shots.
Nic phone guyzz....juzz purchasd it 2days ago...xcept camera...other features r juzz awsum gud phone in all....aftr all sony rockzz..!!.. lovd it..!!
YAH, NICE PHONE , I HAD RECIVED BUYTHIS PRODUCT AT RS 13100. THANK U FLIPKART ,IT IS A BEST ONLINE SITE IN INDIA..EASLIY HANDLING.DUAL SIM . MONEY WORTH.
I pre ordered xperia m from WS RETAIL & got it! very fast and snappy phone unlike the korean copy cat! NFC,4inch display,qualcomm cpu,adreno 305 GPU is super fine to use!
In my earlier comments on other products i mainly commented on delivery service, FLIPKART service is awesome, but here i am going to review this product : I will recommend this product to all of you because this product has everything which i want within 15k.
when i purchased this mobile i received a defective one but thanks to flipkart they replaced as per their promise to customers on their website, and this mobile is upto my satisfactions everything is good,nice design and good sound quality.the only problem im facing is battery is getting drain very quickly,otherwise a very nice phone,i think it might a battery problem of my set only.the previous handset i received was a defective one but the battery backup is very good,but this new handset as a replacement that i received is everything good only battery getting low very quickly.
Its a very good phone in terms of performance and looks. Main pros of this phone are- Great looks, powerful processor, 1 GB ram so it doesn't feel like lagging at any time during playing games or any heavy task. Two main cons which i feel are- 1) camera which is not up to the mark and fails to impress at lot of times specially during low light. 2) Low internal memory which deprives you of installing any big size games. Rest everything in this phone is top notch and bang for buck!! Recommended..!!
u love it......... really nice mobile, handy and very professional, within budget, 4.2.2 is also good, once u purchase u start ignoring friends.... try this.... i took this for 12800, now price has gone up.
I am using xperia mini from 2011!! and,I oredered this phone for my friend,and used it also..u can easily understand from the specs that it ia very good phone in this range...but,i want to mention something,the CAMERA is NOT upto the mark as I feel in using my xperia mini also!! others r awesome!!! xperia rocks once again!!fell in love wd xperia style again!!:) :D
I got this phone 1 week ago and now i have some problems with the device The vibrator of the device does't works and it hangs up
good service. thank for new replacement of Mobile. For all a small message flipkart is Super............., Speed.............., Quality........... etc.
Using this phone for over 2 month Excellent looks Perfect size Nice touch Good Display Sound is Perfect and would suggest buying a new headset to experience the clarity...go for in ear headphones And the best part is Samsung,Nokia headphones are not compatible with this phone....not even Apple. Philips Skull candy and Sony only are compatible Never hangs or lags gr8 processor and RAM 1 GB is just perfect Camera is truly an disappointment because there is high expectation from Sony when it comes to camera though we can expect everything there are always some Cons Finally one advice "At about 13K this is a good phone which would never disappoint you"
Value for money, is all I can say about this phone...doesn't lag lyk Samsung phones...get regular android updates from Sony.Should go for this excellent dual sim operation, good battery backup, build quality is also good.
I am really happy about this purchase. The phone is really superb and thanks to flipcart for their good service
I am using the phone for last 2 days only. Flipkart's delivery was one day in advance. Cons - Battery life is not that great, if compared to Samsung S duos (It runs for a day with 2-3 hours 3G usage). Standby time looks better but I have not measured accurately. Displa uses a lot of battery. Back cover is not very comfortable to remove Earphones with the handset are not that great but still ok Speaker volume is not great There were lot of options in screen dropdown in samsung s duos which is missing here, Bluetooth, Wifi and Internet are the only hardcoded options. Duos had GPS, blockjing and some other options as well. Pros - Sound quality is good Display is good Sleek Call Recorder works with voice input mode very well, nice sound quality Basic applications like email, facebook, google maps work smooth Value for money
this phone gives u everything u need except a sturdy built quality....its dual sim too & has a great display & graphics processor (adreno 305 with snapdragon dual core krait cpu)...battery is much better & long lasting than any samsung cell even with tethering & wifi hotspot usage!!!! go for it if u do not want to spend a billion rupees but also neeed a branded phone....
i am using the phone since 2 months now. good things are sound quality , user interface ,light weight,call quality,pocket size bad thing is frequent problem in internet usage. it says time out again try to connect its not connecting again we need to restart the phone then its working fine.
I purchased sony xperia m dual, last month through online shopping. Look, features wise it is good, but when i used to talk, just after 2-3 min I am feeling pain in head, ears, the handset becomes hot. May be it is radiating harmful radiations which is affecting. Dear friend, if you are really concern about your health, think twice to buy this mobile. This problem never I faced when I talk with my other samsung or nokia phone.
Excellent phone for people who want to work on the move, stay connected, watch videos , take pictures, listen to music, play games. Excellent quality, nice call handling, clear audio. Very Happy to own it.
Pros Camera quality is very poor Apps cant moved SD card Inbuilt memory only 2GB user available IF u sacrifice above quality its nice
Purchased this mobile in Flipkart 25 days back. Initially Camera quality is very low, later upgraded the software to latest version then it's quality is fine.
First thing is first - ***Flipkart service is excellent as always :) *** Though in the first attempt I got a wrong product, but the replacement was real quick. Phone is good, but you can not move app from internal memory to sd card like all other android phones...
The service of flipkart was awesome.received a defective product and flipkart arranged for the replacement immediately.The packing and delivery time were good... coming to the product i would Just like to say that its a very good mobile at this price.
this mobile got latest Snapdrogn s4 pro dual core processor, execellent for gaming and multitasking... screen is nice and clearity of music is amazing,GPS works like charm .. go for this mobile if u r not concerned about internal memory ( 2 gb user available).. Major drawback/Cons- Games and apps cant be transferred to SD card, SD card is used for media only..
Sony name is enough for quality of product. Xperia M dual proves its "Sony" in all department except its camera. .camera is ok but not extra ordinary........... Pros : Android 4.2.2 (preinstalled on device) Nice design and UI Good 4" screen Sony music quality is super Battery life is good (1 day) Good wifi reception Dual Micro Sim Cons : 5 mp camera not produce good result (Not bad) Only 2GB Internal memory for end us in cost of 13k it is better choice with best facilities Go to it............
Xperia M dual is an amazing phone, slim, crisp display, elegant build quality, designed perfectly apart for 1 factor. The part above and below the display is very large and of no use this should have been shortened. After reading reviews I thought I would have to sacrifice camera quality, however for 5 MP its great especially with HDR mode and clicks are awesome in low light. I would suggest a buy!!!!
The phone is a real pleasure to have and use. For those in limited budget this is a great phone super display and great battery life. gives me 15 hrs back up for dual sim and 2G running continuously all day. I recommend this for a must have list.
This is my first android phone and it looks better than that in picture. Camera quality is also good. The only thing i find is that the camera button given on the side is not smooth and one has to press hard. Other than that, no regrets. And thanks for pointing out that the camera has a blue plastic on it ... !!
Awesome phone for this price.. Only problem is it gets heated too much..Really uncomfortable... Other problem is for those who have habit of using many apps.. only 2 gb internal memory is available.. Quality is awesome.. Happy
I have been using this phone over a month now..purchased from flipkart and got it delivered with in a day.. Here is my feedback on this device... Design & look: not much impressive, but I think all Sony phones have a box shape... :-) Call quality: is Ok, frequent disconnects and poor speaker response... may be the problem with my network Dual sim : yes, it's easy to manage both sims..but If there is an option to set a default sim for Call & sms , that would be great. Camera is very poor…Only in full light without HDR will give you a satisfactory output. :-( Proximity Sensor: seems this sensor didn't act well, like the phone dial pad comes up , due to the ear contact or some unknown reason, the phone dials some number that makes the beeps sound or went to mute or activate the notification center or sometimes disconnect the call while talking.. This may due to the way I am using the phone or it's specific to my device... I don't have any complaints as well The 4" Display is just average, a kind of bluishness everywhere, not very clear & vivid but seems ok while playing videos... I read one full eBook on this device using flipkart eBook app and it was not that bad. The speed of this device is very fast. The speed I meant browsing, Facebook, Whatsapp, Gmail etc ..Even the wifi range is also too good. I didn't install any games so far.. so didn't know the how this device perform while playing games.. The other features are like NFC/Tethering/WiFiDirect , bluetooth are working fine..:-) If you want to compromise some -ves I mentioned above(Specific to my point of view), you can go ahead with this device as this is one of the best dual sim phone available in the market.
the phn stopped detecting in computer as well as it stopped charging within two days. dnt buy it. pros 1.touch is good 2. processor is good cons: 1.charging issue. 2. less memory. you cannot save apps in memory card and only 2gb is available for apps
Mobile performance is great. But camera and Display Quality are worst. I agree it has NFC. But my first choice is camera and display. I will give Camera 1/5 Display Quality 2/5 Battery, Performance 5/5
Using the phone for last one week, too good. Iam using Xperia ZR too. Except the bravia engine for display M meets allmost that of ZR. Very good phone at that affordable price. Its going great with 1GB RAM without any lag. Its also going great with 32GB (Class10) memory card. Battery backup is also good. Only disappointing thing is, it came with white normal headset, but we cant expect much more than this at this price from sony.
Hello Friends,i had purchased sony xperia m dual mobile 5 days back from flipkart .Delivery was awesome ..For delivery and customer care, i will give 5 star rating experience...Regarding Product Quality as u know its Sony Brand so buy it without any hesitation.........
Style, Build, Feel is just awesome... 5/5 Performance is good........................5/5 Sound quality... fine..........................4/5 (could have included better headphones though they are not bad) Camera..... Ok Ok.............................3.5/5 Rated 5 because you can't get better than this in such a affordable amount - * NFC, * Bluetooth v4, * 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon dual core * Android v4.2
Got this phone a month back for my dad and I am still awestruck with the features Sony has managed to give out for this price. * It has a beautiful display of course with corning glass * The battery lasts upto 2 days (with few tweaks but 3G on all the time) * NFC (although my dad is not going to use it) * Beautiful handset design * You get Android 4.2.2 out of the box * The dual sim feature is Dual Active (meaning both the sim are always on) * A very good processor, GPU, and sufficient RAM of 1GB makes the device very responsive * For sensors it has: Accelerometer, Ambient Light, Proximity, and Magnetometer. Which is again very good combination. Forgot to test the rear camera when I met my dad (he lives in my hometown) so no review about that. But we use the front camera for Skype calls regularly and looks fine. All in all very happy with the purchase.
if you want to go for big brand with dual core, good net speed and with nfc technology then i would suggest u this mobile as it is best branded mobile at this range
First of all, it will not be surprising to say that I got the phone within 21 hours after placing the order. The phone was nicely packed. As usual, awesome and outstanding service by Flipkart. And now the phone itself; Sony Xperia M Dual is a great phone. For only 13000 INR, you are getting a phone with features, which may not be available in phones of other premium brands, like SamSung, LG, Nokia, HTC. Also, the hardware is very premium on this phone. You are getting dual core Snapdragon CPUs, individually clocked at 1 GHz and a premium GPU Adreno 305. You will not find similar hardware at the same price. So, if your budget is 15k INR, you should have a serious look at this phone.
As opposed to single sim variant of this phone, this phone gets full 2gb of internal available memory. I did a full research before buying this phone. Without listening to all samsung fans saying not to buy sony, i went for it(and i'm loving it). Been using it for 20 days, working like a charm. No flaws, only praises for this phone.Dual- sim works brilliantly. Whenever, i remove the back protection cover, i get awestruck seeing how beautiful this phone is. another treat is it comes with android 4.2.2 pre installed. Only flaw i felt is that,camera is not so good. It gives decent pictures in daylight but poor images in night. Guess you would have to compromise something for excellent feature phone for this price point.

Thanks to Flipkart For Awesome Delivery & Replacing My Freebies Due to Some Defect Freeebies i got..Letz Come to Review Sony Xperia M Dual (Purple) ....Stunning Look...Awesome Features..Worth to buy it...But the Major Con's : 1)Heating Issue:usage of 30 mins it will get heat on back side of Phone 2)Internal Storage(Apps Can't move From SD card) 3)Camera But But iam Strongly Recommended to Grab this mobile Becaues its Awesome Features Major Pro's: 1 GB ram..i can't feel laggy..while playing games 2)Stunning looks feels grate while Using in front of Samsung Users..itz looks High end mobile..GUI is Awesome 3)Battery lasting one day 4)Videos and Music feels damn good.. 5)Internet while Usind 2G Network iam feeling like 3G Speed may be Due to Ram Speed
Bought the phone from flipkart. Slim, handy, fast. But Battery drains out quickly and phone is super hot dont know why! Battery stands for 23 hrs, "OK" camera. I was using Lumia 620 before so, Lumia 620>Xperia M. But sadly is not android and lacks useful apps.......
sony xperia m dual, doesnt made to use 3g videocalling. video chat is supported over data/ wifi networks only.... i hope u must be careful about gimmicks of all android makers, only few androids are able to make 3g video calls... but sony xperia m dual was awesome in remaining aspects... SO, BEWARE in choosing android products... thank u...
Hi friends, i bought this phone(xperia M Dual) before 4 days back. I am not to store any datas such as videos, songs, pictures in SD card. Everthing is stored in Internal storage. Is anyone facing the issue. In my phone settings---.storage--SD card. under SD card there is no option called copy data from internal memory to SD card ... So is anyone of have this option in your settings ? apart from this problem i am ok with this phone.
This phone actually comes with Android v4.2.2. I got this from a local store on October, 7th 2013, as I couldn't have waited for flipkart to deliver it. :D I'm glad that I made the right decision by choosing the dual version over the single sim version. Also don't compare this with Galaxy Core which is nothing but plasticky crap. :P
At last got the mobile. Its a delay delivery from flipkart. However, sony is sony. Its fantastic. The touch is very good. Its a pleasure to have this and use.
I am thinking to purchase this phone but i Heard Many Problem About This Phone Flipkart Is Selling This Phone In Very High Price As Compare to Other Site Like Snapdeal.com And Amazone.in , Tradus.in 1 Camera screen turn into Blue's Color 2 HEATING Problem 3 Auto Restart Many Time In Day 4 No Direct Video Calling Pleas Someone Tell Are This Problem Are True
All the specs are very good and completely worth buying this phone in this price range except few following. - Camera is not so good. - Dual SIM: 2nd SIM is off during the call. - Less Internal Memory: only ~2GB available for apps (from the 4GB Internal Memory) Rest is very good. Display is very good. STAMINA mode is very useful for extending the battery lifetime.
i got it from FLIPKART on 22nd October. Great device, great picture quality,great sound quality. Videos r also looking good. It would be much better if camera is a little bit better specially in the low light photos. The internal memory is also too less i.e. 4GB. MY ANDROID VERSION IS 4.2.2. It is expected to upgraded soon. All in all a great device apart from the camera & internal memory. GREAT DELIVERY BY FLIPKART...THANKSSSSS
1. Service was very pathetic and got the product after 1 week (Even though the Chennai HUB received it much earlier) 2. Phone is good and was using it for couple of weeks, worth for the Money. I got it after discount for INR 11.5K Cons: 1. Internal memory was low mentioned as 4GB however mostly it is used by system and user have only 1.5GB (Could not move the APPs to SD card) 2. Camera - Not good even it is mentioned as 5MP looks like 2MP camera Overall Result: 4 STAR and user can buy it if their budget is around 12K
i ordered this phone on 26/10/2013 and got it on 29/10/13.again nice deliver by flipkart. the packing is awesome.while unpacking the phone i fill will very nice. the build quality is very good..a bit of curved but slim design.sony gives u best quality in music,gaming camera and every aspect of this phone is best in that range.its much better than what samsung and other gives u at that price. battery backup--it lasts whole after watching movie,gaming etc. voice clarity--with sony walkman feels very nice n handy processor--no lagging at all..best performance by snapdragon s4 pro one problem is there i.e. you can not move apps from interanl memory to external.you will fill a bit of less memory in aspect of apps. i think its enough u get 2gb.for apps only so no problem at all ENJOYING USING IT..
sUPERB PHONE IF MATCH WITH YOUR BUDGET THAN GO FOR IT it is pod=siible that in same price you might found more features more scren size in other brand but superb result only in this phone stop thinking and purchase
after using sony ericsson k530i from 5 yrs(still gud) it was my first smartph from FLIPKART. sony always has been my choice n i was predeteremined that i will buy xperia as my first smart ph. n it still keeping its quality (progressed too). so i realy enjoying this1.i have seen/used other company's smart phs(of frnds or family) but in this mid range (cant say above 20,000 k) sony performing a best than all specialy i will talk about samsung that just luks disguting for me. n this samsung making Indian ppl fool by manufacturing sets that have 1 diffrence than its prev or last manufactured set. Performance-Awesome Sound- very gud as sony famillier for it SIM-dual sim bt nt dual standby.its not ne problem at all Display-Very gud Battery-Average Camera-Poor than samsung Overall i will rate it 8 out of 10 .Go for it its best choice. Thanks to flipkart for their gud co-operation.
purchased this mobile from a local store for 13k. this is my review after using for a week. Pros: 1. Smart n slim look 2. NFC 3. Power management option 4. preloaded apps 5. jellybean 4.2.2 cons: 1. heats upto 42 degrees during calls and games. 2. Earphones not uptomark 3. Poor camera...when pics taken with flash. 4. hangs up( happend twice when using google play ) 5. Only 800Mb ram available 6. only 2gb internal available 7. cannot move apps to sd card!
i bought xperia m dual in flipkart in diwali offer its good as mentioned by everyone but i did had a problem in wifi connectivity after installing wifi fixer from the app store its good
This mobile is not so good as I expected. Before purchasing this mobile, I was using HTC desire s. I was pretty satisfied with HTC. Touch & camera of sony is not good as HTC. But accoding to price , xperia m dual justifes its price. Good hardware- 1 ghz dual core processor, 1 gb ram. 4 Gb internal memory is a matter for this mobile, because 2 gb is available for end user. We can't move applicaion to memory card.
i bought this mobile from flipkart no doubt their service is excellent about phone till now i did not experience any lag while using any apps or games its good for games like temple run and subway but takes a lot of time for loading high graphic games... very much satisfied with this mobile some unnecessary apps are preinstalled and memory is a small problem but if u use an external memory card then its fine my rating 4.8/5.... :)
i has bought this product 3 days ago from the flipkart. after using it i has found some of pros and cons o the phone as... pros: latest android version 4.2.2 good looks to impress any one easily almost all app. supported. better quality than any other cheap micromax,lava or gionee phones power stamina mode cons: low batter life camera quality not so clear
I purchased this phone two weeks back, and every time I take a look at the phone it makes me feel very happy and vindicates my decision of buying it. The user interface is great, no lags experienced whatsoever. Excellent product from Sony. Hats off to flipkart for delivering the product in just two days! Very happy and satisfied customer!
A week before I bought this mobile. This mobile phone is very good but that 4 gb memory, which is only promote but the 2 gb phone memory. It is important to provide the software for the 1 gb memory. Unable to move to the memory card without any software. Otherwise this phone is very very good. 1 gb ram memory of this mobile is good because it acts faster.
Sony Xperia M dual is awesome to use... All specifications and features are quite outstanding.. Worth for Money... I absolutely like this product.., and Flipkart shipping is very fast and great to receive the product.
after so much research i purchased this phone . this phone is nice and the service by flipcart is great, but the warranty card is not stamped. hope i dont have problem in near future.
i buy sony xperia m dual. it is very good mobile. but internal memory is low can't move apps in SD Card.
Phone is good use and fast. but battery backup is very poor. if use internet power reduced within half a day. camera clarity is good, display quality is also good. sony for best display.
Switched from Samsung to Sony, and thats a great experience. pros_ 1 New awesome look. 2 Better interface. 3 Preinstalled Applications including whatsapp etc. 4 Sony is known for its Audio quality and this time too not disappointing. 5 Awesome features including NFC cons_ 1 Camera Quality is not good. 2 Internal Storage for end user is 2 gb only, out of which you get 1.41 gb because remaining consumed by preinstalled media. Happy to buy, but one thing Flipkart should add : to provide screenguard and flip cover with phone as freebie, these things dont cost much but sold in market at hiked prices. ............................................................................................................................ This was the review before I returned it back. This was due to charging problem and finally what realised is that its hardware is not good, HTC and Nokia are better in that department. and now stars are also decreased to 1. But 5 goes to flipkart because they are awesome and everyone knows that.
all function is ok but camera quality is very bed .... I got ihis product on 21/10/2013 for flipkart ...camera 1/5 star
Really a good deal!! 1) delivery perfect timing... early than expected. 2) Product - brand new and good. 3) Freebies -- Bluetooth hands-free and smart charger were also new 4) Cahsback - Expecting by Nov 30th 5) Overall -- best deal. I prefer purchasing only with WS Retail. :)
Overall Ratings - 9.5/10 Great UI.. It came pre-loaded with Jelly Bean 4.2.2 not 4.1 as advertised Touch quality is awesome.. Great response regarding processor and RAM Battery is Good too.. played game for about 2-3 hour and battery gone down from 85 to 46 in whole day.. pretty good for an Android device, i'd say.. may be coz of new device.. Good wi-fi reception Great Sound Quality and it VERY LIGHTWEIGHT (most appealing physical quantity) and slim too.. Only Place i'd deduct marks would be : Camera Quality.. not what u would expect from 5 MP.. but Satisfactory.. LED flash not upto the mark.. Disappointed here.. only 2 GB internal usable memory..
If you want a dual SIM phone with brand and good hardware, then it is for you. If you are thinking about buying Micromax instead (especially A113), please don’t do that. Buy this one because I tried both the phones and this one is a clear winner. Don’t buy it from here; check on eBay or Snapdeal first. Flipkart is usually expensive. Pros: 1. Very good clear & crisp display. Even under direct sunlight, it has good visibility. Plays 720p videos smoothly (1080p lags sometimes) 2. Dual sim functionality is flawless 3. Sound quality is amazing 4. Good battery life (lasts one full day even with heavy use). Charging is very quick (it gets charged from 5% to 100% within 1.5 hour) 5. Nice design and overall build quality, feels premium 6. Good overall connectivity (3G, 2G, Wifi, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth etc) 7. Performance is amazing (plays all the heavy games Temple Run2, Subway surfer etc smoothly) 8. 4 Inch size is perfect, anything bigger than this, feels odd in hand 9. Touch response is perfect (better than any micromax shit) Cons: 1. One major con is that Apps can’t be moved/installed to SD Card. They have to be stored inside 2 GB of internal storage. Sony will have to provide update for it (App2SD apps don’t work). 2. Camera is not what you would expect from Sony, bad quality pics
Trust me friends.....at this price range awesome phone it is......Thanks to flipkart for giving me such an awesome mobile at very reasonable price with plenty of offers.....appreciate ur service............Dont think on this friends....get it.......no other mobile has this many features.........Decent looking phone from sony....Tnx to SONY
This is the best phone in this price range.Got all the features that any other phone has within the range of 20k. Display is good, sound is decent (not very loud though), graphics and performance is impressive, battery backup is a low point as any other phone from sony. Also though it has a 4inch screen, the buttons occupy a little space in the bottom of the screen(no buttons below the screen like samsung) which decreases the effective screen area(although the buttons disappear while viewing full screen contents like video or images). All in all, an amazing phone in low budget.
Ultimate touch at this price..same as a high end phone...all shit from samsung and nokia at this price...
Really Nice Phone for this amount range.But I mostly excepted video call option not available for this product. I asking sony why video call option not there. you are giving 3G network & front camera but not available for video call opton.
Fast service from flipkart i got it on 2nd day of my order. I ordered black. Using it for 4 days great experience in using this phone being my 1st android device i feel easy to use. Still now i dint find any lag, dual sim working fine. Really it gives great pride while using before others. only con is 2gb internal memory.
best phone in its price catogry.....I ve never seen any phon so sexy beautiful ever in my life in white color ...it tells the beauty of whit n screen it qhd but beter then Samsung hd screen camera is perfect evn betr then grand sound suprb only cons is bhae ke liye liya kash maine apne liye ese hi order kiya hota.........
I received this phone on Friday.design looks appealing. Quite handy. still using single SIM only.audio quality is good. Display quality is promising. Camera quality is not much great. if you adjust EV value, able to take picture with out blue tint. decent battery life. I have used it for video chat using WiFi for 45 minutes, after 30 mins started heating up. you wont be able to install apps directly to SD card.if they provide sw update for this that would be realy great. Overall I liked the phone.
hy guys does it have any signal dying thing like the bloody xperia E dual . because E dual was such a wrack when it come to all features . worst battery , hanging
I was a great fan of Apple products then i switched to Samsung after their galaxy S2, i bought all their Galaxy Series, and now i have Note 3, just because i love their after sale services, they just replaced my S2 and Note (because i was facing some problem) Now, I bought Sony Xperia M dual for my Dad.. but i must say Samsung have just fake design (same pattern and look on all series, nothing Premium look), but Sony Xperia quality looks so premium.. Conclusion: Very Sleek Light Weight Only problem is Memory (ie only 2GB for Apps) , but for starters or for medium users its fine enough. From now i would like to Buy Sony Xperia products .. :) just depends Sony after sales services.. I fully recommend this Phone because it's awesome in this Price range ..
I bought it a week ago. This phone in purple color looks just awesome and feels compact and slim in hand. The outer body is tougher and better than the Samsung phones' plastic body. Features and hardware are too good. No well known brand will give 1GB RAM, such powerful chipset and Adreno 305 graphics in this price range. Camera and Sound quality is great too. there are Equalizer and Volume booster in built and it feels great with a pair of earphones. I give a Thumbs up, if you are looking for a phone under 15000, this is the best choice.
Ordered the phone in the evening .. got the phone on next day morning in Chennai .. Super Happy with Delivery time. I will rate the phone as 5 still the points where it lags : Cons: 1. Camera .. Mediocre, If you are looking for a good camera phone clearly stay away from this.. the Photo clarity is very bad 2. Display : Video Display quality is not good 3.Dual Sim Functionality : we have to choose the sim every time from which we want to call or send a message. This makes life difficult. Nokia's basic version have a better dual sim manager software. There is a default setting for Data though.
GOOD product feels great in hand ..gets little heated back side very smoth,NICE DISPLAY lag free MEMORY-1.4gb...if u uninstall some app u may get 1.8gb for use OTG support(on the go cable u can connect pen drive) ANDROID version-4.2.2 CAMERA- ok not so good compare to my old cel xperia u SOUND -very good NFC
Got this phone today..Gd service by Flipkart as usual..I am not writing anything about this phone as Everything has been already mentioned by other people. One thing for those who are getting blue ting in there Pics taken by this phone "Please remove blue plastic covering rear camera of this phone".
This is a good stylish phone. Operating is full smooth, memory is ok (manageable), but the camera is bit disappointment. it has some bluish layer in its photo. and no fix is issued by sony yet. but still this cell phone is worth purchasing, may b the prices will drop in some more time. It easily beats samsung and other chaps, good purchase at 13.5k. 4/5 for this phone. Go for it if your budget is within 14k.
I don't own this phone, but have spent some time with it. Seems really wonderful. Looks are the highlight of this phone especially black. Nice to hold, gives the feel of an iPhone(Similar in size and design) Buttery smooth,credits to the 1 gig RAM. Camera is decent for this price tag but shutterbugs wont like it. Tempting device, but there apparently is a camera bug that shoots all the images with a bluish tint. Check out sony blog once or google it. Phone memory could have been a little higher. The device I tried had android 4.1 but people have been posting reviews saying the device is shipped with 4.2.1. Need to check on that ! On the whole a Good device for people who want a awesome dual sim android phone !
Overall Sony has given a nice phone with all the required features in a mid range phone. Comparatively it is best in class. The only con being internal memory which is 4gb out of which only 2gb is available for end user. But battery is good, camera is good, the phone doesn't heats up, music player with sound enhancements is good, awesome looks, nfc, wi-fi connectivity all are fabulous. Sony has provided power management system with various settings in phone to increase the stand by time. The device also performs well in gaming, good screen, awesome touch pad, updated Android Jelly Bean 4.2, also plays clear HD videos, quality of camera is quite better. the phone also doesn't hangs or restarts. So the overall performance is very good in comparison to other phones in this range. Headphones in the package are simple which could have been provided better. But the phone is light weight, slim and easy to handle.
