One of my friends told me about this brand and said that it is quite successful and trusted in china. I decided to go for it and trust me, it feels like any other branded mobile phone with all features but after only spending 6k. Great battery, touch and everything else. No hang, looks good, sturdy build. Reviews for Gionee's Mobile Phones are fabulous over the internet.Way to go Gionee !!
Good phone at this value. Battery life is avreage and camera quality is also avreage. Taking time to load home screen either you have choosen default launcher or go launcher. Temple run2 robocop games played easily on this mobile without any lagging. RAM is always 85% is in used.
I liked the product its value for money. Got all the features at 5.5K. Only stuggle some time feel on RAM which is 512 and Camera Quality. Only challenge was poor corrdination of Amezon with seller and customer. They are just providing a online platform nothing else.
this phose is jusst too good at its price.nice screen nice sound over speakers excellent voice quality. games runs smooth(though i hav not tried big ones).nice download speed over 3g network(i got more than 400Kbps). camera is not that good(3star). overall great phone.
Got it delivered in time... And the phone up to it's price
