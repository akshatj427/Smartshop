Good reliable phone in this price range. Besides the regular features, two features I found useful are these. I normally forget to switch off the phone before going to bed (many people will have same problem, I believe). Automatic switch off and switch on feature, when enabled with preset time will relieve the owner the burden of remember these tasks. I have set automatic switch off at 10pm and I will sleep with peace of mind. This feature is really useful because the relatively low capacity battery. I don't find any speaker grille on the case or front. I think the whole case vibrates when audio is playing and this gives diffused sound instead of directional sound and the sound quality and volume also is good.
amazing..phone....it will fulfil all ur needs..its battery back up is awsm..camera is vry good..and price is very low...@ll in 1..best of panasonic
I bought this but it is a Battery Killer Smartphone. if you watch video or use internet,its battery end under 1-1.5 hour. its battery heat when it is charaged. its flash is not Good. Don't buy this, its not upto the "Panasonic Brand"
The battery does not last from morning till evening. Suspect all bloatwares that came pre installed.
Only one SIM slot was working,the dealer send the defective cellphone
Its awesome phone in such price.
Model is very good all facilities are available but battery backup is poor . But overall good. mobile. i recommended it upon gionee karbon and andriod one .
Android phone with 8GB ROM and 1 GB RAM, but Battery capacity is 1500mAh, funny, will it work for only 1 hr if we enable WIFI, video streaming, blue tooth share & 3G Minimum 2000mah is good
You have to mention detail of this phone.
