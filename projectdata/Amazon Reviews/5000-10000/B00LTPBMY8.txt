Nice look. Light. Slim. Screen clarity is very good. Battery quick charging. I like it. Its worth buying. Good Piece.
Great phone with lots of new features. Offline short features are amazing to operate for phone own. He/She can only access the complete gadget. It would be great if they provide more ram memory for extendable sd card access. Finally it worth-able for low price. Great one from OPPO. Thank you.
The LED flash has to be turned on and of manually , No, It doesnt have autofocus or else autofocus definition might be different for them No Burst shot feature too.
Awesome phone , having agood speed and having a reasonable price
