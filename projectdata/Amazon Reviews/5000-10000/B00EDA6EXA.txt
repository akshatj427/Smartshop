At last I got a mobile with all the features I am looking for and that too at a very reasonable price. Already three weeks over and no issues at all. Not even a single time it restarted. Packaging was good and the product also delivered in time.
Karbonn A10 : This is the worst handset I have ever come across. Battery back up pathetic. Internal memory horrible. Heats up very soon. Hangs very often. Touch screen does not respond quite often. Charger fits very lose from the very first day. Seller Sangeetha, Kathriguppe is of no help. Service centre in Jayanagar, Opp. Tanishq is of little help. Overall a very bad experience. Don't buy any product of brand Karbonn.
