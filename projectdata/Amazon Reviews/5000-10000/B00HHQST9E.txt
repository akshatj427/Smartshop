Hi, This is the 1st time i bought on Amazon and my apprehensions came true on the contents. Before placing the order, i spoke to amazon's customer support who guaranteed me a sealed pack but to my surprise the box though was very well packed but it was not a sealed piece. 2. Except the phone, none of the accessories - charger, battery & headset are sealed in their original packing. 3. There are minor scratches on the screen. 4. battery is 70% charged when i put it in the phone. All in all, looking at the contents, it looked to me as if it could have been a display piece or a returned piece by someone else.
