bought it from ever onwards on amazon, good phone timely delievered. the only drawback is the 2MP camera but at rs. 5200 u cant get better.
net speed excelent good phone, But lack of service center & not availble in shop in navi mumbai. should improve improve dealer network n service in india
At this rate the phone is very good buy, The touch is better than most of the Android Phones in the market. Its worth ... value for money
Nice phone..many gud features in less price..using it from last 3 months..
