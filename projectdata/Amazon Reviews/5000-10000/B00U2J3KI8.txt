I have used a lot of music phones in my time and I have to say that the X1 Beats is definitely one of the best if not the best phone i have ever used. The prising of the phone is absolutely spot on for what you are getting. The sound quality of the phone is exceptionally good regardless of whether you use a pair of head phones or just listen from the loud speaker. As for the rest, the phone is also a very good android powered device so it just works
Excelent, I'd like to express my infinite gratitude to you Amazon. Best site if compare to others. Thanks again
it's awesome, easy to use, user friendly.
