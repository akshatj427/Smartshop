Nice phone Dual sim activated never miss a call. battery back up is good. Phone performance is good. 3.5 inch display with great touch. Easy to change sim switch key before calling.
Recently bought this handset from amazon.com and this is a steal at this price. It is fast enough with its 1 Ghz processor, Good display quality and its features. The camera is also good enough. But the memory is 512 MB which seems to be a bit less. Otherwise its good value for money. Satisfied with it.
The phone had network problems since I switched it on. The WiFi kept getting disconnected every now and then. After making a call, the phone automatically disconnects from phone (2G) network, you had to restart the phone to use it again. The screen had significant lags - with that small a screen I did not understand how. I had to return it after just 3 days of usage.
i have choose this product through amazon it is nice still require more facility i couldn't get flip cover and screen guard for that
