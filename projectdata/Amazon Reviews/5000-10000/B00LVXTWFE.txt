Even though its just purchased fews days back...so its doing fine!...but as usual Samsung battery longevity is not that good...but if your usage is minimal n normal. ..hope it will do better. And Last but not least. ..amazon service delivery is really good...hope it will stay this way, always!
Good product from Samsung in this budget . Only drawback of this product is RAM less than 1gb and Battery back less . Rest features are Excellent and Services of Amazon is outstanding *****.
The display quality is too poor, the processor is too slow resulting in slow 3g Internet, battery discharges too fast. Overall a big NO to this mobile. Regretting after purchasing.
