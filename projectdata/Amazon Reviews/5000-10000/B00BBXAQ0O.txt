there are some limitation in this phone like middle button of headphone is not respond .. no sec. cam .. low RAM .. but overall this is good phone ...
Have used it for a month now. I like it. And, this additional line is to complete the number of words mandatorily required!
For the cost of just 7000, we can experience high resolution and as many number of applications. It is awesome product from Lenovo.
Its a laggy mobile. No free RAM, struggles for free RAM. Better to go for min 1 GB Ram devices for Android. Screen is very Good in Size and Battery is also very good. But overall it doesnot perform as a multi tasking smartphone due to laggy performance. Not Recommended.
Average performance but Camera is superb with good focusing function. Head phone comes with it is worse. . . .
One of the worst phone, I had ever seen..start up is very slow, app to home screen is very very slow. reboots automatically in middle of work. but overall look is good, slim and lite, no issues with the screen quality, can view hd videos in same quality..default app installation path is internal memory (not usb storage) so the memory will degrade when new apps are installed. Cannot move some apps.
nice phone but some difficult to operate not like samsung operation ,of course this may set right in course of time
Screen resolution is not good. Memory capacity is poor. Fails to handle even the few apps installed on the phone.
it is best value for money. i got as it was described in offer. i am satisfied fully. thank you.
