MOBDNGYFE6ETZZEH
I am using this phone from last six months and undoubtely it satisfies me with respect to camera, battery backup, andriod applications, processor. I can enjoy lot of games on it without carrying charger all the way. REALLY GREAT EXPERIENCE......!!!!!
i experience zte battery is pretty good quality.. display is ok.. quite happy with 5 inch display.. camera is average. this phone is good for normal to average user.. not recommended for heavy gamer... over all phone is one of the best in this price segment..
i purchased it 6 mths ago...since starting it hangs...on and off....lastly i faced prob with the airplane mode and the receiving signals ( antenna)...i hve stopped using it now ..as the cust care in Mumbai does not give response on mob. as well as land line ...the after sale is pathetic so is the mobile...not a buy at all...
