Advantages 1)big screen even bigger then nexus5 2)amazing battery life 3)works flawlessly doesn't hang inspire of tremendous load 4)very light weight Disadvantages 1)super fragile screen no gorilla glass 2)lgs custom made apps make the feel of kitkat dissappear 3)headphones provided could be better for such a expensive phone
CamEra clarity-Not at all gooog... Shocking that Lg does nt come up with goood Cameras.. Does not hang.. Multitasking with a dual core Processor is an issue sometimes.. Better phones are available at this prices...

Overall good phone. Easy to use and lot of good OS features..
Go for it superb battery gud quality camera awesome
Nice phone... Good Service.
