Very good phone, battery also quite impressive. Charging after every two days. This is the second Videocon phone I've got after A30 & I'm a happy customer
hello everybody, i have been using this product for quite some time now. the phone is a very good for entry level users. videocon has really done an excellent job with this mobile. PROS:- TOUCH & FEEL IS VERY GOOD, black matte finish back cover is stunning..........u dont have worry for fingerprints, camera s quite good....not excllent but appritiable, both low light & daylight imaging is nice, flash is very good........ QUAD CORE processor is very good & superfast. All types of high resolution games are running just lke butter........i even played NFSMW & GTA VICE CITY & there is absolutely no lag at all. 1.3Ghz processor means it superfast & it proves so. On tata docomo 2G it offered me speds of upto 21mbps.......dwnldng fils are just amazing. THE overall look is just like other android phones but it looks classy than its nearst compettior CANVAS 2.2............screen is nice.......540*960 piuxel resoluton..........& 320 ppi........qHD screen does its duty well..........colours are vibrant........videos play quit well........viewing angls r nce.......however not from bottom view CONS:- Battery backup is not good.......it takes at least 4 hrs for a full charge ( 0%-100%)......and battery also drains well...........however 1gb RAM is an additional advantage........VIDEOCON PLEASE look after ur batteries ANOTHER major issue that most can face after buying this product is service backup.......however VIDEOCON MOBILE service is just about 1 KM form my house, but it can be a problem for others...........datz y........videocon is providing a service center guide almost with all its products.........but i bet u.......thiier service is far far better than say XOLO mobiles.........which r just disgusting. but if u r looking for an entry level android 5.0" inch smartphon, then just go for it..........its really a bang for buck device...........& u wont b cheated at all..........it has all the specs & features one would wish for & can do ur job or satisfy ur needs with ease. ALSo flipkart service is worth mentioning & they r also provding a puoch for this product. videocon is also asurring that they will provide androd 4.4 KITKAT upgrade for this device from SEPTWMBR 2014 or so. Am reviewing this after 1 month of usage & will giv it 4/5 due to that not so friendly battery backup...........however leaving the battery problem.........evrythiung is just fine.........
hi i would recommend buying a mobile from flipkart coz at least u will have 30 days purchase protection and u can return the product if its not good. i made a mistake buying it from videocon showroom in karol bagh. it cost me 500 more than flipkart was selling on that day. why videocon is making phone when they can't provide a quality product.its just like a chinese phone only big in size.the 2000 mh battery need to be charged 8 hrs to get it full and it can be used 4 hrs of very normal usage of talktime of maximum 20 minutes.there are only 8 service centres in delhi.the 8 megapixel camera of a55qhd is not eqvivalent to 2 megapixel of samsung .please buy china phone instead of videocon
I brought this phone from nearest shop of my place for my brother,not from flipkart. this is a nice phone for Rs.9300. I am already using Videocon A55HD,its a superb phone. i am giving 5 star rating for A55HD and 4.5 star for A55qHD. I feel A55HD is better than Apple iphone 4s,i am saying this from my experience. about A55qHD, its 8 MP camera is nice but it not came up to A55HD's quality[A55HD's camera giving quality near or equal to iphone 4s's camera.] . body quality is good, processor is very GOOD, speaker soud is same as A55HD, and about qHD display: it giving better view from 3 sides of the phone,but from bottom is poor. Video quality of the phone is Good and touch responds is very Good. Totally, A55qHD is giving 100% value for money. :)
