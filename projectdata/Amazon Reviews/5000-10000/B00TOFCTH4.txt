I think Samsung is desperately trying to compete with Low priced phones. If so then this will definitely fail. At this price one can get many other brand phones with far superior specifications. Why offer Tizen when Android platform is free? Samsung and others should realise that a sizeable customers don't care for brands anymore, but will try a high spec phone available at throw away prices. Micromax Spark, Lenovo A6000 etc etc. offers are simply irresistible.
this phone runs tizen..why does samsung expect indians to buy this instead of redmi note 2????
