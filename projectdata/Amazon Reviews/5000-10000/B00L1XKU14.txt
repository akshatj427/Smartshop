Hay ,I am Anish . My friend bought its from Market and you can't imagine that the cost of Mob. its above 850 rs , my mind changed any i ordered to Amazon . beleave me both of same rate but you must safe your money by this Site .
Got this for my mom. She was asking me for a touch mobile. Got this for 2500. For 2500 so much specification they have. Strictly for android starters. I will say it's more worth than the price. Anyone planning for a touch phone for starters I will suggest you to go with this.
Superb phone with great battery backup and nice features
Good phone at its range of phones
Good no heating and no lagging
The phone keeps switching off
price reasonable
