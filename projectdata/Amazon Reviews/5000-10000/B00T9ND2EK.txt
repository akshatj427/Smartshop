Bought this phone a couple of days ago. Let me address the pros and cons of the same. PROS: -1.2 ghz quad core processor. It is definitely one of the fastest phones in this price range. -1 GB of RAM+Windows OS lets you run heavy apps or/and multiple apps at the same time. -Speakers are pretty loud. -Battery lasts for about a day with moderate usage. -Touch response is good, although the hardware navigation keys need to be pressed hard sometimes. -Expect a Windows 10 update any time now. CONS: -No backlight. -The fixed-focus, no-flash primary camera is not good at all. Front camera is a disaster. -Phone feels chunky and the edges are sharp and hence not comfortable to hold. -No USB tethering, the great Windows OS doesnt allow us to download files larger than 50 MB with cellular data (Dear Microsoft, not all Lumia users have Wifi in their houses/offices/nearby places to download large files. So if you're reading this, please consider allowing download of large files and updates over cellular data. Small changes like these might bring some life to your ever-dwindling user base). -Basic tasks like sending files, changing ringtones and installing local apps etc. are so complicated that you'd think twice before performing them again. -Phone restarts automatically if I shut it down and plug a charger to it.
At first I appreciate Amazon for their prompt delivery. I am writing this review after my 2 weeks of usage. I like the phone, its design & performance is awesome and it is also a pretty budget phone. A good choice for the users who shift from android to windows. It has all the main features like 1GB Ram, 5MP Camera (Superb picture quality even without flash at daylight, not preferable during night time clicks), 1.2GHz Snapdragon 200 quad-core processor (Really superb quick), its capacitive touchscreen gives you feather touch experience. When comes to Battery backup it gives you full day fun with one charge even connected to WiFi all day long by texting, gaming, browsing, and one more special feature is it's Battery saving feature gives you complete 8-10 hrs standby to attend phone calls and texts when battery down to 15%. When come to apps it has all the popular apps that we regularly use and don't compare the windows apps with android apps(you will surely disappointed with missing features), but this phone has nice user interface and it never get hanged like android phones. This phone had windows 10 update guaranteed by Microsoft and we hold latest OS in our phone in future also. Additional Benefits: 1. Paytm gives you 750/- cash back(150/- for 5 months) on recharges done with its app 2. A great discount on Bus booking using Redbus app 3. Airtel gives you 500MB 3G data for 2 months. 4. One drive gives you 30GB of free cloud storage. *********************************RECOMMENDED PRODUCT**********************************************************
I got my Microsoft Lumia 532 a couple of weeks back. I am in love with it. It looks so good, feels extremely classy as well as stylish. The operations are super smooth. The preloaded apps are simply wow. The dual SIM feature is quite handy. Also, even though the phone camera lacks flash, the outdoor photos are pretty decent. Moreover the VGA secondary camera is good enough for Skype calls. I would suggest people looking for a smartphone in this budget to go for a Lumia 532. Trust Microsoft.
If u use it then u got to know what is a mean of touch and camera for phone in 6k Awesomeness in touch, battery and camera and don't think about Apps every major App are there. Just go for it....
This phone is not bad at all. I think this phone is better than Moto E 2nd Generation. But Moto E will cost you 7k. All most all features are same except the battery capacity. Performance of this phon
Nokia 532 comes equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdargon 200 1.2ghz quad core MSM8212 proccessor with an Adreno 302 gpu. This is just okay for the price of 6k-7k. Yes it's definitely a good initiative from Microsoft to provide an alternative lumia for the budget seekers but I think this phone is dated. Plus why should someone go for Lumia 532 when you can get Lumia 630 with a Snapdragon 400 cpu and a clear black 4.5 inch IPS screen for 6k.Yeah it's true that Lumia 532 comes with 1gb ram but it simply doesn't have the cpu nor the gpu to fully capitalize on. Since this is a windows phone the 512 mb of RAM would be more than enough for all day to day usage and only while gaming on high graphics the defieciency of RAM maybe felt.Even you can go Lumia 638 with all the internals of Lumia 630 plus the 1GB of RAM is available at 7k, i.e the same price of 532! Since not only the performance, even the screen quality of 638 is much better than this. People looking for a good phone at this price (irrespective of the OS i.e Windows or Android) go for Android one for 5.5k or you can even wait for the Redmi 2 that's expected to come in a few months for 6k. Microsoft introduces this phone at a time when budget users are spoilt for choices with so many alternatives at their disposal. Had they done it a year before then it might have attracted buyers but not now. plus their pricing policy is also strange! They are even competing with themselves by making Lumia 630/638 sell for a similar price! Only pro of this phone is that it is a dual sim variant while the 638 is not. But you can get a dual sim variant of 630. And only for this feature I am providing 3 star. Otherwise it would have been two!

Nice mobile, and wow lumia camera...i thought it's good..not bad...no difference between 435 just a the camera ï“· is 5 mp...for more information call me at 8609990030
bought this phone as a short term fix for my moto g which is bricked... let me be honest i liked android and thought will never go out of it.. windows changed my mind.. such a cool and simple interface.. its fast damn fast compared to any android device having 2 gigs of memory.. loved the simplicity of the windows phone os... however app market is low.. I hope it will grow in future... coming to build.. it could have been improved... camera is not upto the mark... waiting for Windows 10
I got this product in correct time . The phone finishing is quiet good and front and back camera both looks too ordinary...removing of back panel was very difficult with given information on manual and i searched in youtube for some video for opening this panel ....the charger of this phone is too thin and i dont thing it will last long and headset also is like old nokia headset it could have been better
I was using android phone. When switched to windows phone it was difficult to use. Moreover many apps were not there in the store. The one's that was there also was different. Eg what's app, and it was not user friendly. Battery part is good. No flash light for camera. Price wise it's ok. It's an oook product.
Nice Phone in this price! Battery and touch experience could have been improved.
Real value for money... Touch is really sensitive... Good job Microsoft
Very disappointed by amazon... received product yesterday at 5:45 pm and made a request for refund at 6:00pm... the moment i switched on the device, the half left part of the screen was not working.... :(
Good windows phone....in an affordable price with 1gb ram and 8gb internal (we can only use 3.7). The mobile is so user friendly and windows os lovers will really like it...
Phone is good... but delivery is average.
I was satisfied to Lumia phone.
Not up to the mark.Camera and display clarity is not good at all. In this price range go for Samsung mobile.
Nice phone with low budget
This phone is just awesome. Everything is good about the Phone. Ofcourse, you can expect a very high performance for its price. Very good product from Microsoft.
Awesome product. No defect with the device. Good packaging. Thanks Amazon.
Poor Battery Back up. Standby Battery is just 24 hours without any use!
Best Phone overall at this price point
As far as windows OS is concerned, it may not be much competitive as Android or iOS. But it offers smooth and protective performance. I agree with the limitations with regards of apps and games, but being a windows user I never found it an issue. This when compared to Lumia 630 sports mostly similar features and differ in some points. Got 4" display with 233ppi which results in sharper display than 630 as it sports 219ppi for 4.5" Clear black display & Gorilla glass avoided here for cost cutting. Clocked with 1.2 ghz snapdragon 200 with 1GB of ram for high end gaming with flawless performance. Smartdual sim support with both the sim support 3G like 630. 5MP rear camera and VGA camera in front for video calls etc. No flash and you can't record 720p with this but 480p resolution can be done. Overall a nice phone but this if released earlier before selfie era, would have been a better and best seller one for this price range...
overall good phone in budget also will updated to windows 10
It's a great phone, have to own it.
