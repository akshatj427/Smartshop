Very nice phone. I am using since 1 year and face no any problem. Great phone
using for the last 10 days, found many faults 1. software glitches 2. camara quality is not good, doesn't sound like 13mp camara. 3. most important BATTERY BACKUP tooooooooooooooo horrible... even for normal usage it lasts for only 3hrs. had to charge more than thrice a day. good thing is speed processer, can play any games without struck. it has the BEST EXTERIOR DESIGN.
phone is hacked many times so I am not happy
It's good
Worst camera 4gb internal memoral Worst. Speakers battery But all others things satisfies Selfi touch speed are good. Enough to buy good product for discussion cost
