Well I didn't buy this phone from flipkart but its the same thing.... Pros: -low price -Good RAM -Good Processer -Comes with good in-built features -The Transfer b/w Internal and external(AMAZING!!!) Etc Cons -Low Camera 5MP - has crashed 3-4 times since I bought it(7 Months)
The main drawback of this Lenovo is their Service Centre. It was owned by HCL touch (Kolkata) and they treated the customers in very bad manner. They more offen, stolen our batteries, some internal parts and break some internal parts while they deliver our handsets. And the Customer Care is totally funny. They never listen and never help you anymore. They just play with you until the customer left because of their harassment.
Used it for almost 9 months and it has been a decent experience, there are a certain backdraws such as the phone hasn't got an update of the latest latest android it's still at the jellybean 4.1.2 and it heats while charging, while the camera quality is average and the shutter sound can't be turned off. at the same time is light and thin and handy and has a nice touch reciprocation with a good interface.
Lenovo "A" series mobiles are not good in build quality, I have used there "P" series mobiles they are best than this. ----------------------------------------------- Thanks Flipcart for Quick Delivery
