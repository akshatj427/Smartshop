Cemera quality not gud. Display looks very poor quality. Net speed is gud.
All is performance is good but camera clearance not good
Excellent and amazing device. Only thing no OTG support such a good device. All Micromax phones having same problems. 100% - 5*.
Shipment thru gati courier was a real bad experience. Product is ok though.
using it for last 10 days. quality is awesome. battery life is 2 days for (calls 1 hr, games 4 hrs, internet 1 hr, music 1 hr). supplied mobile cover and screen guard are very nice. My doubt was cleared after getting the handset: 8 GB internal memory and 1 GB RAM. Many websites are having 4 GB internal memory and 512 MB RAM for the same model. It's really fast. I'll definitely recommend. Thanks to Amazon.
Value for Money fantastic Mobile .. You can gift it to some one the way I did
size is too big difficult to handle but very gud to show off
