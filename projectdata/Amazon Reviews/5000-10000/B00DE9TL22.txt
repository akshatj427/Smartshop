It is a very nice phone and was delivered fast by Amazon.com. Though I liked the phone in all respects, I had to return it because it would not connect to wifi unless you were close to the modem without any walls in the way. No hassle return policy of amazon will make me make more purchases from them.
Phone is good but it gets switch of at the time of charging notnot get switch on after that....so i don't have any other option than returning it..... JBL headphone are just awsome it offers music experience just like you have never heared before......
Music quality isnt that much high, but for the price u r buying it, its a steal. Micromax's mediocre OS skin annoys a bit.
Nice product Really good but battery in 2 week I m happy The Head phone is very best quality. Amit
it is good.I get the piece right time & what ever my requirement is fullfilled by amazon, so happy with this.
