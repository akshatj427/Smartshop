waste product. Shuts down intermittently. Can be switched on again by removing the battery and replacing the same every time.
Worst......The size n design....touch n network strength worst.I m selling mob since last 9 yrs.it was the socking experience....... More more more....the call get picked up automatically.how ever its ur money.mk ur own decision.
I have purchased 3 phone going by his specification and the price tag, however sooner i find that the calls get automatically picked up even if you don't touch the phone, secondly your apps stops working unfortunately and you dont have any other option except to uninstall and re-install and this you have to do 3 - 4 times a day, especially if you are a whats app lover. I personally suggest do not buy this phone and there is no updates yet with co, for these bugs.. I want others to write a genuine comments not like in flip-kart where its seems this phone has all good things in it. If you have any solution then let me know apart from clear cache & data of every app because this i do 10 times in a day but its still not working.
Sensor not working
Nice phone fully loaded and nicely priced in Amazon
Very nice Fast good looking. Good battery backup
Sensor not working. Software or hardware issue ?
Nice product but battery backup is not good
its worth for 5.5k but camera is dull...
Worst ..... Please don't buy
value for the money
Pros- Speed Superb. Graphics good Game like subway surfer running Good. Cons- 650 MB RAM already full (I am trying to figure out why ? Plz let me and other know if you know first) Whats app Crashes. Phone heats when playing games (Using Internet and charging). Flash quality not good.
