Xolo is an AndroidOne partner, but Xolo One is NOT an AndroidOne device, even though it has almost the same specs as those Android One devices from Micromax,Karbonn and Spice. Performance : Quadcore Mt6582m is more than enough for your daily day to day tasks. You can even play many of the popular games without much issues. Software: Xolo has released an Android Lollipop update ( Jan 16th ) for this device which is great considering official AndroidOne devices supported by Google are yet to get this update.Advantage AndroidOne devices have over this is that they will get software updates for 2 years or so from Google while support for Xolo One ends with Android L update. Camera: As you can expect in a Budget device like this, Average. Battery: 1700mAh, not enough if you use 3G data a lot. AndroidOne devices have the same capacity battery. This won't last one day of moderate usage with 3G on. Xolo One vs AndroidOne Even though Xolo One got Android L update before Android devices,support for this device ends there, while AndroidOne devices will get updates for another 18months or so. One advantage Xolo One has over AndroidOne devices is, it has better build quality. It comes with a Leather back and looks better overall.
