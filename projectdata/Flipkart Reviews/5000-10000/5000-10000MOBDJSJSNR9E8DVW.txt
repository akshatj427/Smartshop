I started using this phone 1 month ago when it led to a conclusion that there could be no other best deal at this range. sleek design, reputation of holding a LG gadget, latest versions(Android 4.1.2), really promising battery life ( 3 days with average usage), IPS display's what counts in splendid bright view, and no hanging faced till now, and guys satisfaction guaranteed what else one asks for at this price range!! go for it !!
after considering all the features this is the best mobile @ less price but one thing is there it is having very small screen size and it having latest version of android 4.1.2 jelly bean it can be hang also. whats your openion in this case
Hi. I got this phone from Flipkart...in July 2013 end. The delivery from Flipkart was somehow not as prompt as their reputation. My past experience with Flipkart has been excellent but they failed this time: forgiven! Now coming to the phone...I was delighted with this beautiful gadget. Bought a 32 GB SD micro memory card from HS18 and loaded 7-8 basic apps when the first signs of trouble began. The microphone stopped working. I reset the sound settings, it still did not work. The only way to operate the phone was through the speaker and therein started the nightmare. Tried every trick in the world, right from checking the sound settings to removing the second sim, unmounting the SD memory card, removing the apps downloaded (like watsapp n so on), rebooting the device and so on but it refused to budge. Such a fall from grace... Have finally got in touch with Flipkart and they are 'looking into it'....I don't want this crap...I have an iphone 5 already, this was suppose to be my secondary phone. Please suggest which one should I go in for...I want Dual Sim, 3G, Wifi, Pushmail, Android Jelly Bean (even though I prefer iOS and Win 8) below 10k...not open to Lava's Karbonn's, Xolo, Intex, Salora et all...
