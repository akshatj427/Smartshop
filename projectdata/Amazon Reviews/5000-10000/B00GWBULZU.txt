This is an amazing phone that gives more than what is its price The speakers are very loud and are perfectly clear and crisp The internal headphone jack is DTS enables and they give amazing sound with no loss of clarity at any point The screen is perfectly crisp though the viewing angles are not so good The processor is 1.3 GHz and the phone is fast and snappy We will get a total of 1.2 GB for apps and 1.2 GB for mass storage. The phone will play and HD and modern game at playable frame rates with no lag I have tested real racing 3 (with root due to storage problem) gt racing 2 ,temple run 1 and 2 , angry birds all. This us a perfect phone for all be cause I previously came from a note 3 and I am perfectly satisfied with this phone . I am a audiophile and I listen to all genres of music the audio test for this phone is equivalent to that of the s4. The design is simple and looks very nice The antutu rating is 12000 The only defect of this phone is average camera quality other than that the phones build quality performance and sound are nothing below top notch
this phone is available in less prices in other sites approx 4500 only .actual price is same .but standard charted credit card provide 10% cash back thats make price around 4500 . I am not using this cell phone but I have seen review that is best phone in market in same prices category.
At that price I do not think you can get a better phone. Picture quality is good, sound could have been better, overall a good phone for kids
Has everything that a typical android phone should have for just Rs. 5,000. It works excellently as a smart phone.
Karbonn A15 is very low price and very decent phone i love the phone and amazone also very nice service
Very poor karbonn i hate ur handsets total bakwass
