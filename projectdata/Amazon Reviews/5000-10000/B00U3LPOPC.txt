Good phone but the phone heats up very fast while charging n while playing games, most of d games lag on this phone cuz of 512mb ram, as mentioned in d specifications it does not require a micro sim n it supports 3g very well. I would prefer this phone if ur not a hardcore gamer. Stylish design. Looks gr8 in hand.
