Lenovo S880 is quite good for Rs.18000. It is much more faster than the galaxy grand and displays graphics better than it. The phone has a large screen which is a sign of clearity. The rear camera is quite good while the front is not so. Lenovo also offers a wide range of apps that makes the the phone more better. S880 displays good graphics and doesn't lag while its competitors galaxy s2 and xperia go do. Lastly, quite a good choice for money. I used it quite a bit more and got to know that it lags a bit in some high end games like dead trigger, asphalt6, etc. but... once again prices SLASHED and it turns out to be more worth for money
