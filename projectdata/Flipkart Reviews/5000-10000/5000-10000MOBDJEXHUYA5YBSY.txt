Recently i bought this after lot of research. Main feature is ultra light weight just 125 gram. Holds in one hand perfectly. Those who complaining about old hardware just go to near LG shoppee and experience it first then comment. Buttery smooth operation. RAM 200 MB+ always been free. Good camera. My every friend laughs at me first as I bought LG phone but after using it they are stunned. i am quite happy with the device. If anyone has any queries feel free to ask. PS: choose white color.in looks it beats Galaxy grand
I have been using the LG L7II P715 Dual for the last two weeks and must say that this device is a steal at this price point unless you expect it to work like the high end mobiles.This phone has enough to make an average Android user happy. Somehow LG has not taken off India like the other 3 majors but has sold more than 10 million units in the west.So here are my observations so far on the mobile Pros: Bang for the buck with High-end features like Quick memo,Quick translator,Q-slide,DLNA Smart screen,On-screen phone etc... Slim,sleek and very light. Bright 4.3"IPS screen with fluid touch response Optimus 3.0 user interface is slick has good customization options A decent hardware config including a dual core processor is more than enough for moderate users who aren't benchmark freaks Good dual sim setup with smart forward and Polaris viewer 4 at this price point is a bonus Good 8mp camera w/ LED has features like panorama,cheese shutter,image editor, burst mode & more Huge 2460mah battery charges quickly and offers above average talk time Link option(like HTC) merges most of the contacts/accounts seamlessly which is much easier than in a Samsung Most Apps can be moved to SD Card Cons: Capacitive touch Menu keys are not back lit.(am used to it now) Finding screen guards and cases is not easy(for most LG's i guess) No signature option for text messages Internal memory of 4gb might not appeal to gamer's On the whole,this is a phone you cannot go wrong with.The only reason why people might actually not consider this phone is because its an LG and also because their marketing is pathetic compared to the Samsung's blitzkreig.Try it at a store and am sure you will like it. cheers
Really great phone.....worth in this price..... Always think practical while buying such things.... Never compare this phone with other brands like Karbon, Xolo, MMX etc....Most pf people compare this phone or other branded phones (Samsung, sony, etc.) with above mentioned brands. Think about after sales service also. LG is a brand so no worry for after sales service. Excellent UI (User Interface), Battery Life is great, touch is smooth, By default launcher is great enough, no need to download any other launcher from (GOOGLE PLAY), Camera quality is really good, Music (with Dolby sound system), Video quality thumbs up, Dual core and 768mb RAM is fast enough, at least 250 - 350 MB RAM remain free. Go for it.....
most ppl thinks that LG is not good company to trust on ... but its totally WRONG they r world leader in TV , AC , Refrigerators etc now they r showing muscles in phones with optimus G and optimus G pro. about this phone yes its a bit old in hardware side with cortex a5 processor but if u see the following pros u wil prefer it over others: 1. lg awsome IPS LCD screen 4.3inch (bigger than desire X 4inch) 2. DUAL SIM not availabe in this price by other international brand ( htc desire sv , galaxy grand > 15k) 3. HUGE BATTERY of 2450 mah OMG!!!! grt 4. jelly bean out of the box COOL !!! 5. DUAL CORE .... superb!! 6. Qslide -- its a feature just like samsungs multiwindow , u can see two application at a time ...SUPERCOOL :D 7. Qmemo - same like Smemo of samung , take a screen shoot , edit , draw , share in fb ... 8. its camera has continous shoot like dslr also panoroma mode too :) trust me i owed two lg phs previously and they r very durable and problem free .... yes now i own HTC which is made of anodized aluminium so dnt expect such preium feel of HTC or Xperia Z or Iphone .... AT 15K ITS THE BEST LOOKING TO BUY IT AS MY NXT PHN :)
Have been using the phone for about 2 weeks now, so here's my take on it. PROS: One of a kind mid-range offering in the Indian market at this point in time with 1 GHz dual core, dual SIM w/Jelly Bean, although this can change overnight, given the competition (Of course there is MMX Canvas HD A116 but its problem is availability) Smooth display and intuitive Jellybean UI Sleek design at 4.3 inches Above average battery life (it lasts for 1.5 days on avg with moderate usage - talking, browsing, messaging and some music) CONS: No backlight on capacitive buttons, so u initially need some practice with the buttons in the dark Does not play/record HD videos 768 MB RAM - for this price, u shud get 1 GB RAM. This may not be a big issue, if u r not a gamer The speaker should have been placed closer to the earpiece Had a hard time finding a screenguard for this model (retailers were surprised to see an LG model!)
4.3" Display 1 Ghz Dual Core 768 Ram. Android 4.1 Moreover I attracted by Design. Good Looking. Order placed. Waiting for delivery. First purchase from flipkart, Read good review of Flipkart. More update after dlvry. Update : Very fast shipping, already shipped, Waiting for Dlvry. Update2 : Just got it. Very fast service. Appreciate Flipkart. See u after the break with detail review. Ram : 356mb Used and 263mb Free
After a long search i found this phone is the best one with this budget, but we have found that a major drawback as it won't play and record HD or full HD video. One of the store representative demonstrate this by sharing a HD video to this mobile from his mobile. And this was not aware of me and my friend. Actually we planned to buy this mobile, but this seems a serious drawback from our point of view... So please read the reviews and test it by near by shop before buying any product like this. Please think twice before buying product like this....
The phone comes without a screen protector or casing which is bit disappointing. PROS: 1) 4.3.inch Screen. 2) Smooth touch Screen. 3) Looks Beautiful. 5) Very Light and Slim. 6) Android 4.1.2. CONS: 1) POOR BATTERY LIFE. ( With 30 minutes of talking,30 Minutes of FB,45 Minutes of whatsapp...you will end up with only 8% of battery.) Pathetically Poor Battery performance. 2) HEATS UP EASILY. LOTS of LOTS of HEAT.(Seriously I am Not happy with the level of Heat generated by the Phone) ( Finally, I figured it out to keep the phone under acceptable level of HEAT by Disabling Internet and GPS and keeping the brightness level under 25% ( Sometimes the phone doesn't allow you to increase the brightness level beyond 60 % saying "Brightness level can not be increased due to temperature". That things makes the Phone a Showpiece only . Its impractical to use the phone with that level of heat generated.If you can disable FB,Whats app,Mails,Line App for most part of the day..then the phone will not bother U...Otherwise its a Nice phone without any Specialty to Cheer. Seriously I am really really disappointed.
Just took a glance of this mobile in a near by mobile shop. Its looks quite premium in hand. Features are top notch too. Hopefully this would be a good hit in the middle end Android devices. Music is loud and crisp, I however didnt like the 8MP camera. LG really need to work in this front as well in order to face tough competition from Samsung & HTC. Overall I feel this is a good product and LG is stepping forward in judging customer need & expectation.
This Is the best phone in this price. Android v4.1.2 8 MP Primary Camera 4.3-inch IPS LCD display Dual Standby SIM (GSM + GSM) 1 GHz Dual Core Processor (Qualcomm MSM8225 Snapdragon) And The Best Part Is Its Battery "2460 mAh" Better than Xperia Z and HTC One. No HD Recording Only 854 x 480 @30 fps.
Initially thought of going for a Micromax mobile in 6-8k with similar features. But was impressed by this and voted for the brand. I hate Samsung mobiles for the Uni-Design policy. So finally went for this model in another site for 10% discount. Got it for Rs.13,125. But I'm severely disappointed by the signal reception. My Airtel signal is fine, but my Aircel signal has been very poor. It shows full signal, but when I connect to 2G net search for a site in a browser, signal goes off. With much difficulty even it connects, browser goes blank frequently. I wanted a good mobile mainly for stock trading during office hours. That's why I paid more for the brand. But I'm severely effected by this incompetent mobile. It fails to connect to any site most of the times and even it connect, it fails during final transaction. I'm really pissed off with it. At my home, my Aircel signal is total blank, which is my primary SIM. My previous Spice MI 350 (Lenovo A60 re-branded) and basic temporary Celkon mobile used to have at least half signals at my home for Aircel. This phone is not catching any signal even from terrace. Even screen quality looks poor and my friends too said same thing at first impression. To hell with the IPS display. Reg Camera, I don't see much difference b/w my previous Spice MI-350 3.2 MP cam and this 8 MP cam. Only positive is, it's very light-weight, slim and looks so small. No-one is believing that it's a 4.3 incher. I'm still not able to digest that it's a 4.3 inch phone. With basic feature of phone (talking on phone) defeated, I don't see any difference between this and a MMX or Karbonn. My colleagues who have Samsung Galaxy S or Grand are much happier and have faced no issues till now. I regret my decision now. And I was impressed by the 2460 MAH battery on paper. But in real, it discharges very fast even on standby with internet off and no usage. It has gone down 20% in 30 mins without any usage. I clear the cache and memory too every 15-30 mins. Even the looks were impressive on Flipkart for black, but in real it looks like cheap plastic mobile. My colleagues laughed when I said it's original price is around 15k. And the phone goes blank while opening Gallery, for long durations. Overall this phone is a disappointment and not worth the money spent, for this price you expect quality which you won't get from this phone. Edit after 4 weeks usage: Still signal reception is biggest problem. Any one of (inconsistent with both sims) the sims will show 0 signal. At a time only one sim shows signal most of the times. When I change the phone to Airplane mode and revert back to normal mode, then both sims catch signals. But that also lasts for only sometime. Sometimes, switching on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth also restores missing signal. Strange but this awkward behavior is true. Due to this issue, missing lot of calls. At same places, even my spare Rs.1000 Celkon mobile shows better signals. Occasionally lags during normal usage too (am not a gamers). Battery % is not showing correctly. It shows drastic fall in battery within minutes. But I never faced total drain off. Lasts more than a day on normal usage. Positive points are: Compact size and light weight, good display quality. Samsung Galaxy Core at 11,500 is much better option. It have much better specs like 8GB ROM, 1GB RAM. LG l7-2 have 4GB ROM & 768MB RAM. Price difference also is around 3k. Finally, I recommend against buying this mobile.
First of all I will like to thanks Flipkart.com for delivering this product within 28 hours. Pros: Comes with flip cover:) Excellent display and great viewing angle. JB out of the box. Cons; 768mb of ram Battery(battery drain within 3 hours of Internet usage) Lags while playing 28mb 2d game. Not for gaming. Poor quality head phone. Hope battery life improves after prolonged used. (Flipkart.com team please advise if you think if their is manufacturer defects with my battery)
good phone huge battery i am getting 13 hrs backup with 3g and wifi.... it cant play full hd videos... screen is good... pretty good looks ..best dual sim phone till date buy it its good and cheap ..
I was searching for a phone under 15k.I bought LG Optimus L7 II P715 through flipkart and delivered in just 4 days in Bihar..Very fast service now i am using this phone since last 15 days and its nice there was doubt in my mind about its battery back up but its battery back up is just unbelievable using 3g service my battery last 48 hours so do not worry for charging.Display is sharp, also no heating problem after long using. battery charges full in just 1 hours.I can play any type of game without any problem but its not for heavy gamers.Phone is so light you cant feel that something is in your hand.Sound is smooth you can play any type of video but it does not support HD video its a major drawback.Camera quality is nice but can be better than this from a brand like LG.Overall i will give 4 out of 5 for this phone.
I bought this phone from a local mobile shop on 26th of June as it was available at a much lesser price (Rs. 14750/-). Camera quality is good. Sound is good. It worked well for 2 days but the screen started to hang at least once a day after 3rd day. The phone restarts automatically sometimes and it takes hell lot of time to read the SIM. Another problem started 2 days back when the screen started to flicker and also i'm not able to increase or decrease the brightness of the display, the phone does it by itself (I wonder what technology LG have used..:P). I realized I've bought a wonderful phone with so many features so thought to share it with everyone. Hope it helps. Note: Experiences may vary from customers to customers. 2 stars just for picture and sound quality of the phone. I've lost my faith in LG. Hope LG will set a benchmark with its customer service and help to restore my faith in it.
best phone all the features available not too big or not too small with and avg size that all will love...................................................................................................................................
Samsung/Micromax sucks...... Very gud phone from LG best of all mid range phones. 4.3" Display 1 Ghz Dual Core 768 Ram. Android 4.1 Moreover I attracted by Design. Good Looking. Bang for the buck with High-end features like Quick memo,Quick translator,Q-slide,DLNA Smart screen,On-screen phone etc... Slim,sleek and very light. Bright 4.3"IPS screen with fluid touch response Optimus 3.0 user interface is slick has good customization options A decent hardware config including a dual core processor is more than enough for moderate users who aren't benchmark freaks Good dual sim setup with smart forward and Polaris viewer 4 at this price point is a bonus Jst go for it....
After long research I bought this phone by seeing the look:(. This is my first smart phone. Look is good, No lags , display is Clear , Camera Quality is good , but basic functionality is not working. If i talk more than 2 minutes it produce so much heat, if u touch the phone with hand literally u can feel the heat. if i use with earphone which they gave me other person cant hear my voice properly. Am really disappointed. I called LG customer care today they said they are off today. Hi Pransesh, Sorry to say this :(, Please give five star if the product is good.. not b'cos of Flip cart service... please let us know what issues u faced...so tht it will be helpful for other buyers.. b'cos 15k is hard to earn Guys please let me know anybody else is facing this issue. Now i turned off Data ,Wifi , GPS everthing. but still same :( Thanks I went to LG service center , they said some issue is there and gave me the replacement certificate. Now i replaced LG with samsung grand. Though i spend 7k more to buy this grand Now Life is Gud :P Hi Pranesh, sorry am saying this , Give 5 star rating if ur satisfied with the product :( not becos of the flipcart service... what issues u faced..pls let us know. so tht it can help other buyers...b'cos 15k is hard to earn...
I bought this phone from a local retailer. Unfortunately the phone died in two days after a water mishap. Service center asked me not to invest more money in resurrecting the dead phone as motherboard and display both were gone. Cons with the phone 1) No HD recording / playback. 2) Poor/Nil sunlight visibility. I took out the phone in sunlight, had to move the brightness level to 100% but within seconds the brightness dipped down automatically to 61% and would not go back up citing temperature issues. It was only 30 degrees outside. At peak summers I dont know what would happen. 3)No backlight on menu buttons on screen. When in darkness, you will learn the button positions by trial and error 4) Under room lighting conditions the display is bright but not as crisp and detailed as my earlier two year old xperia phone. 5)Speaker quality is average. Didnt get much chance to test out the cameras.
Good Phone , Great UI , I am happy with the internal hardware .. but not very happy with built quality .. also didn't get the 8 G.B SD card :-( . I ordered the phone on 5 April, 2013 and they added this Sandisk 8GB memoery card on 8th ...Not very happy with Flipkart this time . Hope someone is reading these comments .. Also the blue dart delivery is not that great compared to ekart ..Sorry 3 out of 5 this time
After all my search, found it best considering budget, looks & features. Go for it................................. Coooooool mobile!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
please dont buy this phone bcz it only have 1.78 gb of user available memory and gaming performance is worst. It cannot play basic games like subway surfer or temple run...its the shit coming out of LG once again.. i bought this phone in JUNE '13 and i'm seriously dissatisfied with it and want to sell it asap
i have been using this mobile since one month...i am satisfied with its performance...good call quality..nice audio..camera is fine..but we cannot record hd videos...biggest backdrop is it's internal memory.out of 4gb only 1.7gb is left for users for storage...so this mobile is not for gamers...but u can install the games directly to your external sd card if debugging is done using android sdk manager...
I bought this Mobile (Not thru Flipkart) 2 days back. following are my opinions 1. Currently running smooth. 2. Good Speed 3. Smooth & Fast Touch Response 4. Camera, nice performance compared to my old HTC 5. Battery , with my usage still at 42% after full day use. But I don't connect net full day. Some things I noticed 1. I tried to play HD videos but not playing. 2. When we take out battery & insert again then strange error occurs, says use genuine battery, but if you switch on with charger in then no error. over all, very good, Value for Money.
1. out of the box Jelly been nice. 2. Good looking device. 3. IPS good Disply. 4. Unique LG's feature like Q slide, memo, translate etc. 5. great battery 2400mh. 6. value for many device. cons. 1. low RAM only 768mb.that should be 1gb 2. dual core good but Aderno 203only that should be 225. 3. Vedio recording only respected 480x30p that should be 720p 4. not hd vedio ply only respected that should be 720p HD 4. low pixcel 217p LG has done great job in this range but something should be more. overall the device is value for many if u accepted some con then go it .
It is the best android in this budget. And also it shares the same chipset and gpu as the HTC Desire X.
I have used, nexus one and galaxy nexus before. Now I wanted to try out a mid range phone. this phone works like a gem. played nfs hot pursuit, temple runner so smooth. this phone definitely is good competetor for samsung galaxy mobile which are over priced .
First of all I'm very Thankful to Flipkart for their Good delivery services within period. I bought this phone start of this month, I think its not too early giving a review, because I'm using it from last 20 days, Its screen is so smooth & quick responsive, also Dual Sim with Dual Standby is one of the plus point of this device. Device look & flip case is awesome. As I'm a racing game lover, I installed many of racing games all work fine without slowing down the device. Front Camera quality is also good, Secondary camera quit disappoint because it is VGA but not bad. Overall I'm Happy with this Device. :)
God knows why people don’t consider LG as a premium brand. LG is the manufacturer of Nexus 4! Spec wise this mobile is superb! No other company has this much of features within this price range. Looks is also fine. But, does anyone know about the SAR value of this phone?
lg has done great job with this product only look wise n inside has old hardware that could not be faster as lg has mentioned 1- Dual-core 1 GHz Cortex-A5(old hardware) 2- Adreno 203 3- 480 @30fps not 720 vedio recording frnds. if u r a gamer n like high vedio ply then plz dont go for this
I bought this phone more than one year ago. No problems found yet its working perfectly. Now i get an OS update from LG. Now my phone running in Android 4.4 kitkat. And also i got updates like Qslide(the multiple application interface of LG), Dolby digital plus, DLNA and lot more
Some times the single sim only eork one sim network not shown. Upgrade error--> the upgrade version is available from lg. But it requires pc suite to upgrade from through your pc/laptop. even i did all procedure properly again and again i got error to upgrade os. I did not get any proper assistance from anywhere. Even though i tried to search related this error all world wide users get the same upgrade errors from this mobile. I ask onething from lg, please give old upgrade method like without using pc suite. The new method that was not work properly. Or give proper video assitance.
I agree to most of the reviews that, its very reasonable phone for its price. The main drawback I have noticed is that it doesn't have a vibra feedback for touch.
got this phone unexpectedly... it was fairly slow when i used it with the jellybean os but after i updated it to kitkat it became unbearable....could'nt even attend any calls when in emergency.... display quality is the only good thing about this phone but wont play 1080p videos, 720p videos would get stuck and the cam is just ok... gaming is horrible!! go for moto g
Dear all, I am writing another review after using it for a year. Pros 1. Good looking, Slim mobile at decent price 2. Decent resolution 3. Decent photos in day, however very bad photos at night 4. Excellent sound when listened through headphone,decent when listened through speaker. 5. Average battery life. Lasts around 30 hours with data and wifi both off, lasts around 24 hours with only wifi on and lasts around 12-15 hours with mobile data on. Cons 1. After starting up each time, it scans the device (i am unable to find the option to disable it) which takes around 3-4 minutes. During this period, phone hangs a lot and during emergency,you may be in trouble as the keypad sometimes doesn't come up. 2. Only 4GB memory out of which we get only around 1.75GB which is not at all sufficient to install apps even if you transfer them to the SD card. 3. Dual core processor. Somehow acceptable. 4. 768 MB RAM. Somehow, you may get through if you do not install much apps. 5. Very low ringtone at beginning. It will start in ascending mode only. No option to change it. 5. The four soft buttons are not lighted, however it doesn't feel odd after a few days usage. Overall, an average phone for 12k. I bought it for 14.5k in August 2013.
This is a crap product with cheap description. I have been using this product for 1 year and all the time the mobile irritated me like anything, Please don't buy this friends. the reason are below. **Too much heat when speak for 20 mins **battery is waste(not holding charge) **Camera is waste(like 5MP camera) **phone crashes often So, totally wasted my time & money :(
I have been using this phone for last 6 months. After using I found that phone does not display hindi text properly. Text is truncated in the corners missing one or more characters from end of a line which is very irritating. I called service centre and they said they know about the issue and they are working on to fix it. But till now there is no software update to fix it. I request not to buy this phone. There are better phones in market.
This product is generally good - But the IPS touch screen display seems to have some issues. For example, I have set a 4 digit numeric PIN to be entered once locked and when I pick no. '6', it takes the no.'3' and says wrong password! Similarly when getting an incoming call, sometimes the green tap option does not work properly. You need to drag it with your fingers for a larger distance - almost max to the screen height, to open the call. Of late, after 3 months, when I switch on my camera, the screen goes complete BLACK and not able to see anything that the camera focuses. Not sure of the issue. Also, when I try to view the existing photos already taken, after two photos, when I try to move to third one, it closes and comes to Home Screen. Think I will be walking to LG Service centers for all these problems and not sure of outcome at this moment.
its very light compare to other phones. Flexible to use. its really worth. Easy to use.price is also reasonable Nice one
I am using it from last 11 months and do not have any complain so far. Dual Sim with many features and good configuration at this price. Good camera quality. Sound quality is good. Sleek and light weight. Overall good product in this price range.
I heard this mobile is working pretty awesome i ordered two mobile black working greater faster than white, still after 1 month installed (removed) more then 2000 Apps yes it is two thousand apps even though it working jest like that. for this budget a always recommend this phone and flikart for faster service, they delivered next day i ordered, i always thanks to flipkart for their faster service and LG for the brand phone LG optimus L7 P715, Simply i like it and i love it,
Though my unit had some issues this phone looked good and is ok in the price range. Camera was really good. Further at this price point xolo and micomax have much better features. If you are not wary of brand names go with one that has more features. But overall OK.
Think . the battery could be little long lasting.. sleekness, weight is less. good satisfied. camera is descent good enough
A wonderful product, satisfied with the performance. Over all it is good package, Pic quality is good , but in night it is not upto mark.
I like to explain cons only rest all would be pros. 1. Touch is not so effective. 2. No back light on captive buttons, you need to practice to use in dark. 3. Poor Battery Life, If you believe to Pick & drop the calls only then Ok for U. 4. Heat problem while charging 5. Samsung 5 MP camera is far better than this. 6. Auto brightness is missing. 7. Hard to find the accessories for it.
You want everything in one mobile so buy this one and experience you own,it's all in one i am very happy with my lg optimus l7 p715
poor signal receiving ,most of time when ur traveling it totally loses signal u need to restart every time you can pay extra and buy better phone
Specs.. Android v4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) OS Dual Standby SIM (GSM + GSM) 1 GHz Dual Core Processor Wi-Fi Enabled Expandable Storage Capacity of 32 GB 4.3-inch Touchscreen 8 MP Primary Camera 0.3 MP Secondary Camera.. Delivered already even though the order was just given yesterday.. 2nd update later after delivery..
Really worth buying, good quality Camera with Auto Focus, screen resolution, battery life and ace of use and many more. Must buy this instead or Samsung grand, galaxy series and iPhone 4/4s. I enjoy using.
I have purchase my phone in june 2013 but still screen guard is not available in LG store even their service is too bad. Two time i went to service station. Those peoples don't even care about your problem And main problem is camera. 4 Out of 10 pics by camera are coming faulty, only black images are showing. When i went to service station they are just reinstalling software nothing else. Even though still problem is there. My suggestion is not to go for LG product.
I dont know much about mobile phones. so i always do lot of analisys. i bought L5 last year untill then only sumsung was there in my mind. but after using LG hand set i realy felt very happy even today it looks brand new. performance wise very good. only games little difficult. other wise LG sets are user friendly. Two days back i bought L7 ii for my brother better display. 8 mp camera, light weight 125 grms, very good looks. 2640 million amps battery. quick memo. all ar wornderfull features compare to other samsung phones. 1 Ghrts , 796 ram may be the drawback for games. But surely a great value for your money.
FANTASTIC MOBILE WORTH EVERY PENNY. best mobile pls dnt compare this mobile with micomax karbon. It as ultimate battery backup, light weight. nice camera. dual sim superbbbbbb
iam very happy with this phone. battery life is extremly good with respect to specifications light wieight good camera good display ......i recommend lg
It is the best phone within the range.I have been using from past 3 months,it is very user friendly and got awesome pic quality and hard set tooo(i have made it to fall more than 5 times :) if this would happen with samsung then it keeps on hanging n hanging... Just Grab it!!!
Good display, Nice processing speed, good battery backup, Good enough for daily usage. Overall A comfortable Product if u r not looking for Samsung, Nokia etc. Nice experience with the seller with a quick dispatch and early delivery. Looking fwd to do business with u again.
Galaxy Core vs LG L7II Dual Considering that I have used both phones, some quick review on the pros and cons of each. Looks: L7II looks premium and attractive, while Core looks dull. L7II definitely wins on this one. Has the looks of a 20K phone. Display: Again L7II wins. Galaxy Core isn't bad, but not so good as L7II's. Camera: Both are equally bad. Images can be used only for facebook and such, not for recollecting some nice memories. I would put Core to have a slight edge here (Considering Samsung phones in general have better camera). LoudSpeaker: My opinion may be subjective here. For music, L7II seems louder but has a higher treble. I've tried different equalizers but the sound quality isn't good. Galaxy Core may not be that loud but the quality of sound produced is definitely better. Processor and RAM: 768MB RAM for L7II, 1 GB RAM for Core and same A5 processor for both. Unless you are doing some gaming (in which case Core would win) you wouldn't notice difference here. At the worst, both would be equally laggy. Considering Samsung usually does good job with optimizing the software corresponding to the hardware, theoretically Core may have an edge here. Touch Sensitivity: L7II wins. Has good screen. Battery: L7II has an outstanding standby time. With dual sim the battery % drops max 6% at night (50% brightness, ~7 hrs) when I check it in the morning. If you just use your phone for some occasional apps, browsing and making calls, the phone would last for 2.5 days with dual sim, which is a great thing for this price range. L7II would win in that aspect. But for prolonged gaming, 3G and app usage, L7II's battery would drain quickly compared to Core. So for gaming and heavy 3G usage, Core is preferred. Fact to mention here is, Samsung phones in general are optimized for the battery, so the 1800mAh in Core is not a disadvantage. Dual Sim: L7II has dual-standby while Core has dual-active. Not important for me, but Core is better in that aspect. For the price both the phones are worth depending on your needs. I liked the L7II better as I do not game much and it gives me a solid battery backup.
For the money & the features it provides, I recommend you to buy it. The touch sensitivity is awesome. pros. Design is Excellent. Speakers are good. everything is working well till now... cons. The internal memory is very low. sd card, says that it is emulated. The device gets hot soon.
I purchased this phone offline 2-3 days back, the graphics is pretty cool, the phone is quite durable (fell from my hand twice, no damage thanks to the hard case provided with the phone, the 8 MP camera in the rear offers you ability to take some cool shots without clicking the shutter u just gotta say cheese or smile to get the shutter going on. The music player is also cool although sound quality has room for improvement. The video recorder is also quite nice for normal amateur videography. The phone has a 2300mAh battery which lasts quite good for a day with music playing for more than 6-8 hours continuously without major strain on the battery. For the call makers it is a good phone with good sound clarity, the sms has a thread like view which is nice. Temple Run 2 game experience is not good as the touch is at times too sensitive but for other low end games like T20, Tennis normal first person shooting games experience is quite nice. unless you are hellbent on getting simply awesome experience on graphics and sound this is a phone for you at a reasonable price What more LG gives you with the phone LG TV where u can watch TV action on the phone just by using your Mobile internet connectivity. At Android 2.1 OS the experience is quite pleasing although price should have been at least 2K less to make it awesome.
Fully satisfied with the product. Havent checked everything thoughly yet but features like GPS (maps, navigation, etc), Skype (video), browsing works very smoothly. The LG TV app lets you see TV channels live without any breaks in voice and video (low quality - but looks quiet decent in the screen size of this phone) - somehow even on a 2G connection. (Watched and compared live news channels on TV set.) Camera is also good, but of course not exactly like a 8MP standalone camera quality. Build is very good. Light and feels quiet small. Very high chances my next smartphone would be LG. And as I have always seen with any LG product (I have been using various LG and Samsung electronic products for over 12 years now) - LG has always guranteed a basic quality - over time and product range - which I have too often found missing in Samsung.
One sim is not reachable wn talking on other sim....Any solution for this...While purchasing i was told that both sims work at same time... how to solve this problem. other wise phone is very good. battery back up is amazing
This model has heating issues, when you play game for a while, brightness reduces to 61 % and if try to increase temperature it gives error : "unable to increase brightness due to temperature increase"
Really an awesome phone... i have experienced many phone but this one really great at this very low cost...I got before 2 weeks it works excellent.. go for it without hesitations.. And also it comes with dual sim thats very much worthy... Battery life sure for 2 days whatever and however u use the phone... Hats off
The Samsung galaxy s advance is a better offering at a lower price. It has even got the official jellybean update in India. So no reason to go for Lg. Samsung galaxy s advance has a far better processor and GPu. the battery is also fine. My advice is to go for samsung.
Got this mob(not Flipkart huge mistake should have done it), starting playing with it, still now ok no major complains, with Jelly Bean buttery smooth, ram tries to suck up a bit, battery i just love it, dual core ARM v7(Snapdragon) clocked at 1 GHz at least what AnTuTu displayed, all in all nice phone as it is makes major mid level phones a handful. Although i say the touch screen buttons back light was not there, is it manufactured like this or i had a problem in my mob..?? can anyone help if the had bought the mob..
kya kahne yar bde time bad lg ka koi acha mobile aya hai ips display dual core frant camera bhi hai ...... 768 mb ram Finally.I did a lot of research and read lot of reviews. Finally Short listed. 1. Galaxy S Advance 2. Desire X 3. S3 Mini 4. Atrix 2 (Though this is a 4.3 inch screen I considered this for it excellent battery life).. but I decided to go with lg optimus L7 2 and got it in hand today.
