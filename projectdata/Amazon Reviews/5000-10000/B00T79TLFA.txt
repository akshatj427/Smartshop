Awesome phone in this range.much better than moto e or Asus zenfone 2.Front camera is excellent and blink capture is brilliant.Buy it immideatly
Few resembles with karbonn s19....wonderful cellfhone in budget range with a rare front flash...for b'fl selfie.
Early to comment but its good. Camera not that par as showing in TV add.
Good mobile camera are so good
ekdam faltu mat lena.....wastage of money
Phone looks very good I like it's design but there are some problem with this phone 1. Battery charging takes more than 2 hours to charge and within an hour it drains up and only 50% remains. 2. Heating issue 3. Games like asphalt8, smash hit when started phone hand and only solution remaining is removing battery 4. Speaker quality very poor when enabled during call
Very bad.. Hanging problem . touch also bad.
It is good low budget phone but camera quality is terribly bad..... Also very thin back cover which can easily break.
Ok
