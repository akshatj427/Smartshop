Yes., there is big concern with the software in Spice stellar 518 Infant HTC and Samsung have the same concerns I never. It's hard to bear with the software issues on daily basis even after coming from the service centers and followed their standards of using these mobiles. Service centers never have the stable resolution for this but befooling costumer. Touch screen of this Spice 518 in top upright is sense less. Complely useless mobile. Waste of money
