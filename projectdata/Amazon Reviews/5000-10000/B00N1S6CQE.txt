I didnt buy this from Amazon. The product is wonderfully made and the build is solid. I bought it from a local shop as a gift for my father. The screen is just wonderful ans it surely looks bright. Only con is the battery life with barely covers a day. Rest all is fine with the phone.
Its awesome and the service from amazon is trustworthy
Plzz specify the colour of the handset.... I have ordered it thrice but I m getting gold colour whereas I want silver colour.... So plzz mention the colour
I bought this 1 month ago from amazon. phone is grt, looking nice & thin. but front camera is worst and battery life is not so good. and otg not supported... but overall it is nice budget phone.
