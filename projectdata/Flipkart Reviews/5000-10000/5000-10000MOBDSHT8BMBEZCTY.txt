Well for the price around 5,000, its a decent phone, however, with low price comes expected issues. Firstly, the phone is way to heavy to be easily carried around in pocket, sounds average but right away I have faced issues with its internet connectivity which possibly a mistake from my end but to be honest, its lesser user friendly. Go for it if you are comfortable compromising a bit on functionality for a competitively lower price.
Hi i brought this mobile few days back and its a decent mobile. 512 Ram 5'' display Dual Sim Front and Rear Camera with Flash Android V 4.1 WI Fi hotspot 1 Ghz processor internal storage is quite less only 512 mb,but we all use a memory card. Altought i not purchased from flipkart due to overpriced. But for an average user its a budget phone..who need a big phone in this price range.
It is decent Mobile to use. I purchase this mobile decent rate. One draw back is Rom is less. Other than it is good to use.
