B00LV2OZ52
Worst Camera phone. Never think to buy if You fashioned about Camera. It Claims that it is a 8MP Camera, but Provides not Great than 5MP, Also Don't have Needy Camera Settings. Except for Camera, Performance is quite Good. It has "Qualcomm Snapdragon 1.2 GHz Quad Core Processor" on board, which is Smoother in Operation. And 9mm Slim Stylish Design with light weight of 125gms provides one-handed easy use. My suggestion for Karbonn is that, It should at-least claim camera as 5MP and not 8MP. Provide Kitkat upgrade for this, so still can make the performance of device smoother with Qualcomm Snapdragon chip-set. Reduce the price for below Rs.5,000/- so that needy can buy the device without any hesitation. I recommend Go for Karbonn Titanium S20 instead of this device. Click this review helpful, so that all can found this review and also Seller and Karbonn can find-out what fault of this phone, and Can develop for Next.
