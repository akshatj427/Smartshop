Bought this phone from another online store. Here I found some negative feedbacks so writing this review to help buyers. I was using HTC XC CDMA + GSM phone and now using this phone for more than 3 months. If your purpose is voice calling this is the best suitable CDMA phone. If your purpose is gaming or pure data usage this is not recommended. Compared to my HTC in price and performance, this is an excellent phone. Price of HTC XC is around Rs.18,000/-, while this phone is less than half of that cost. The advantages I felt in HTC were good built quality, good camera, OTG pendrive support and easy transfer of phone contacts from old phones through bluetooth. Except these qualities Haier E718 is far better than HTC XC. This Haier E718 phone has crisp and clear ear piece sound with clear loud volume, can hear clearly in fast moving bus. Good signal capturing even in low signal strength areas. Battery backup is very good. Loud ring tone volume. No overheating. Touch is smooth, no lagging. Overall highly recommendable for calling purpose. Unboxing video of this phone is available in UTube. DISADVANTAGES Not suitable for high end gamers. Camera is average. Display is average. Flip cover and tempered glass screen protector is not available in the market.
