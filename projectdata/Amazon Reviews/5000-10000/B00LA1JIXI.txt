Its one of the most versatile mobile sets on offer from Nokia. I have been using it since a couple of months. You can download all andriod apps . I have even downloaded MS Outlook and it works like a dream. Battery charges fully in just above an hour and gives two days backup. I would definitely recommend it against Apple, Samsung and other so called pricey sets. Its camera is decent in daylight. Night shots are very average. But its fantastic on performance otherwise. Call clarity is superb. Go for it.
Brilliant phone in every aspect. Runs butter smooth, no hanging issues, no lagging, brilliant battery back up but it depends. About phone's functionality:- thru '1mobile market', one can install google play services or google play store or YouTube, but all of them are not compatible. But of course why we need them. use dolphin browser to run YouTube flawlessly. any of the two sim cards in the slots can work 3g and the other will work 2g, just check the options. uninstall unnecessary inbuilt software. google maps, google search, google chrome, nokia here maps, es file explorer, opera, etc run very smooth. the design of the back cover is really good, you won't need any flap cover or back cover, just screen guard if you wish. the Nokia x2 feels sturdy and stylish. since there was no swipe software for typing, I installed 'swiftkey' software and now I can type just by swiping, and it is pretty fast. this is last phone from Nokia as a company. if you have any query post it on amazon.
excellent phone in this price, no problem of hang or slow processing. awesome processing. you can install any android aap on this phone. u can also install google play and service. I recommend everyone to buy this phone.
its a unique piece from nokia android+windows.. Don't think just buy it quickly.. From my side welcme nokia again again again
Poor quality of plastic...build is not good at all. I had Nokia Lumia and was no where close to Nokia phone.
