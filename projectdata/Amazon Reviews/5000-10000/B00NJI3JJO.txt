This is the best phone I see in this buget ... Camera quality is very good. Touch is excellent... No hanging problems which I faced in Samsung... Very nice phone.... Look is very good... If u r confused in micromax canvas fire,Sony xperia and this phone. I will prefer to go for this phone bcoz its customer care service is good.... Fully satisfied... No complaints about this....
I m using this phone. Awesome processor. No hang, runs smoothly, with 1GB ram. Battery is also awesome 1700mAh and camera is also good.. Touch screen is also very good and capacitive. Must buy this phone.. Better than Micromax canvas A1
Bought this phone for my sis..and its pretty good... Nice specs for this price... Not just on paper but in performance as well... Thank you Xolo and not to mention Thank you Amazon..ï˜Š
Phone is heating on playing game. Not recommend to other to purchase this phone because very-2 heat on using minimum 15mins.
