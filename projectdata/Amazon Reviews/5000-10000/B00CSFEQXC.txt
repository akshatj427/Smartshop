doesn't compromise ,as the expectations in vain with this price range in sony...never trust from online.this is my experience from purchasing it...sad
Its one of the best android mobile in its price range . Its classy and i really like its style .For me i really recommend it .
Every thing is fine ex except that the phone is somewhat slow.camera quality is not better.
