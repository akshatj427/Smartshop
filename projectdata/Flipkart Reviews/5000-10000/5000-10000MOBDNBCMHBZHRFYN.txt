Hello, I purchased this product 10 month ago for Rs. 6,995 from Maxx online shopping. Battery life: still good (3-4 Hr while talking and 14-15 Hr standby) The configuration of the phone is enough to fulfill the requirements of a smart phone lover but, the RAM (512 MB) may depress you. It wont allow (will show low memory) you to run additional apps if it crosses the memory of 400 MB. In consequence of demerits, the phone is lil bulky. Rear camera is OK but front camera never mean 2 MP. Finally, i would recommend this product but only when if you are getting it for within 7,000
Configuration of Maxx Race AX9Z is nothing but a mere higher digit number. It offer 8 mega pixel primary camera but its picture quality is poorer than 5 MP of other band mobile like samsung. Secondary camera is of 2MP but it work like Vga camera......rest function are normal which you will find in any other smart phone ranging within Rs.5000 to 7000. Buy this product only if u want to so off ur friends that u have got large screen size phone.
I bought this phone in a hurry from a dealer near home as my old had smoked out.And for this price (around 7k) it is really good Pros - 1. Huge 5.3 display with good resolution (960x540), 5 point multitouch.not TFT ,but still good viewing angles 2. MTK6577 Dual Core 1.2 GHz Cortex A9 processor.more than enough to run phone smoothly 3. 8 MP autofocus with Flash back camera and 3 MP front camera.the quality is good for the price 4. 512 MB Ram , 4GB rom with 2GB user memory 5. It can actually playback and record 720p videos smoothly ! 6. Front LED Indicator light for status display 7. Android 4.1.1 8. Of course 3g,wifi,GPS,bluetooth all present 9. Good build quality 10.Good 2300 mah battery, easily lasts a day 11.SAR value is less and does not go above 0.72 Cons- 1. A bit heavy,but not as much to pain your hands when held for long 2. The sound volume is a bit low,but can be fixed using apps to increase volume 3. The company headset is strictly average,but a good quality handsfree gives superb sound ! So what else are you guys looking for ? at around 7k, this is a steal for the price.GO FOR IT !
