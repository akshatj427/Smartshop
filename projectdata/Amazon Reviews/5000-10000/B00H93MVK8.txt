The mobile device seems to be good one and reasonably priced. ZTE is a reputed Chinese brand that has its global footprint in Telecom equipments. In fact my first wifi modem supplied by BSNL was a ZTE make and it worked fine, in fact is still working. That way, this brand, though not very familiar in Mobile devices, is a old work horse where Telecommunications is concerned. This device sports 8 MP camera as well as quad core processor. Although the hardware is not spectacular, but considering the cost, it is more than adequate. My only grouse is that this same phone is available for less than six thousand on other shopping sites. Overall a good phone to have.
Hi, I purchased this phone about a month before, the product found to be good meeting all my expectations of functions. The initial worry of in common name went off as timetime passed. , soft touch is good, battery life is good, screen appearance is good, but the phone's volume is low with the ear plugs. Another area of improvement is the phone is not on kitkat. I am still in search of automatic update of software. The internal memory is only 4gb.
Super phone
All is good except camera and GPS sensor not working no area find in map
please update price other online shopping sits it will be only 6999 rs
