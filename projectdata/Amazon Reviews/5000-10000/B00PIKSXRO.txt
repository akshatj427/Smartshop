-awesome in mid range phones -Dual speaker enrich sound -high graphic games run smoothly -Touch response is great -Camera is decent Cons: -Screen has no protection so better of using a screen guard. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Best mid range phone so far........ i am using it since two days...but not found any cons other than that it...... every thing is good ....you will like it.... whether its camera, screen resolution, touch, sound, looks all the things are upto marks.... I AM FULLY SATISFIED WITH THIS STYLISH PHONE>>>>>>
I hv been using it for three months. This is worst fone. Dont buy it. I am selling it for 1500 rupees
Amazone give product delivery on time... But Quality Of Mb. Phone not satisfied.
All features are good enough except battery back which is comparatively less
