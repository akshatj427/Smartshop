Sony has a knack for producing good-looking phones, and this one is no exception. It does everything you'd want a smartphone to do at a knockout price of a disposable phone. Great screen clarity and touch-sensitivity, although wireless performance could be a bit better.
This is the WORST phone that I've bought ever in my life. Touch sensitivity is creating lot of problems and twice I had to visit the Sony Service Center. Moreover, the phone hangs frequently. The overall response is very slow. Image clarity is very very poor. I'm really disappointed at this. I advise people not to waste their money in buying this product. I never expected such as CRAP from Sony.
the phone doesnt work properly , Im trying to get a replacement The touch screen started malfunctioning and even after a data wipe and factory reset , its not working right Now I have to go waste time at the sony service centre to get a certificate to get a replacement not fun , when it was a gift for someone
Phone is good.. Loved the business... This phone is totally recommended. I would be referring my friends as well to buy.
I would say it is best deal one can have for an Andriod 4 phone from Sony under Rs. 9k. Using it from more than a month now and more than 100% satisfied. Would not have wished for more!!
Feel of the phone was very bad. touch was not responsivee and it hanged a lot. Overall not worth buying.
Gives so many problems(s/w and h/w). Please don't buy this phone
