This is the best phone I see in this buget ... Camera quality is very good. Touch is excellent... No hanging problems which I faced in Samsung... Very nice phone.... Look is very good... If u r confused in micromax canvas fire,Sony xperia and this phone. I will prefer to go for this phone bcoz its customer care service is good.... Fully satisfied... No complaints about this.... Also Brown color is very Royal color comparison of black & red color. Back Brown Leather finish is look Royal stylis phone.
Was problematic from day one. the back option button was not working. Google play and google maps were crashing. However the return process was successfully completed by the seller.
Worst phone.. Did not meet any expectation.. Battery will not last more than two hours.. Please don't opt this phone.
