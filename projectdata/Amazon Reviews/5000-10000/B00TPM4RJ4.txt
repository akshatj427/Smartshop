Not happy with the purchase, especially since I bought it from Sangeetha. If I had bought it from Amazon, I could have returned it. But now I can't even do that! The android one phones are much much better at a lower price. Sold it on OLX the day after buying it. Pros: - slim bar - large and bright display - doesn't heat up - plays HD games like contract killer without any lag, crash or frame drop - includes a built in flash light app which doesn't switch off the light even if you turn off the screen - long battery life even after playing games continuously, and fast charging Cons: - very very very very very very unresponsive touch - slow scrolling - imprecise touch: if you want to touch something, the thing next to it gets selected If the touch were better and the experience had been smoother and not so irritating, I'd have seriously kept the phone and given it 5 stars. At such a low price, the specs were awesome. The phone had a lot of potential. Lava, please fix its touch. :(
Pls don't buy this phone it senser not working plus touch not done properly sometime network not found auto swichoff become hot in charging and so many problem
Lava Alfa ki jitni tareef karun kam hai. 1 budget phone khareedna tha mujhe and is budget phone me bhi woh saari khubiyan hain jo kisi mehenge phone me hoti. 5 inch ki badi screen, latest software ke sath sath quad core processor aur 1 GB RAM bhi. Performance dhaansu hai phone ki. Camera bhi bohot khoob hai. Intne high specs isse kam daam me milne mushkil hain. Kamaal kar diya lava ne.
