I purched Karbonn Titanium S9 on 17/7/2014, and 13/8/2014 my phone CAMERA OPEN FAILED, GALLERY NOT RESPONDING, & KARBONN SERVICE CENTRE NOT ACCEPTED, Service centre talk this is not a karbonn products, MY Rs. 11987 Totaly lost!
Every thing is good but one disadvantage is quickly heating during playing game or charging.

I bought a Karbonn Smart Titanium Octane Plus on 18th October, 2014, from Croma in Ahmedabad. BILL DETAILS ATTACHED! On 22nd November, 2014, the phone stopped charging altogether. There was a loose connection in the Mini USB charging port. I was in Malaysia at that time, stuck with the faulty phone. On 5th December, 2014, I went to ​THE KARBONN SERVICE CENTRE in Andheri West, Mumbai, stating my problem in writing (phone not charging). Despite having mentioned categorically, when I went back on 6th December, 2014 to collect my phone, they had just re-installed the software and not done anything about the charging problem. When I brought it up again, they said come after half an hour. I went after 3 hours. They had charged my phone and it seemed to be working again. On 7th December, 2014, it stopped charging again. If I sat with the pin and hold it tight it would charge. Not otherwise. I took the phone back today, 8th December 2014, and they now tell me that they have to send the phone to the company and it will take them 30 (THIRTY!) working days to fix it. Considering the holiday season being round the corner, I presume it will become 45 (FORTY_FIVE) days by the time I even get to see the phone! ​THEY EVEN TRIED TO REASON IT OUT THAT I WAS NOT USING A KARBONN CHARGER, BUT ANOTHER CHARGER. A MINI USB CHARGING PORT IS COMMON ACROSS BRANDS. SO PLEASE DON'T TRY TO FOOL ME! ANYHOW, EVEN A KARBONN CHARGER DID NOT WORK!​ This is just ridiculous! What am I to do for 45 days without a phone? Can't believe Karbonn now has my money and my phone! I want my money back and compensation for all the distress I've had to go through because of KARBONN'S faulty phone!​ P.S.: I HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN TO THE CONSUMER CELL. I WILL SEE TO IT THAT KARBONN'S NAME IS RUINED FOREVER! Regards, Archana Iyer.
