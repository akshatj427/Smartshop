Using this phone since may 2013....No words to describe...if you want check the rating of this phone..download Antutu from google play..you d be feeling much good :-) coz this phone has higher benchmark then Samsung galaxy note 2
Excellent mobile, Value for money. Appreciable courier service delivered it before expected time....

Simply superb and Handy one.
Wonderful Phone Best Features 1. Batter life (It will last for at least 2 day in the day to day use) 2. Cost (very decent features in < INR 10000) For the rest of the features/pros and cons you can review other websites which has the technical details
