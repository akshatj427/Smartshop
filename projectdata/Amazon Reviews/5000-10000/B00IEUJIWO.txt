This mobile is excellent. I had a little problem. The CDMA SIM I had with me was from MTS. This mobile is meant for Reliance CDMA. I felt sorry for the inability to use this mobile, because it provides the best combination of features for CDMA+GSM combination at moderate budget. The battery performance is unmatched by any other handset.
Trust me this is the worst phone one can have.It hangs on its own...forget that you can use bluetooth,wifi etc.. this phone hangs even if you connect with its charger........camera also hangs....horrible phone......please donot waste your money for this phone, its pathetic ........
Good Phone Battery Running long With full Charge 512 Mb ram Thats y Software Work Slowly Working With Reliance CDMA Only....
There was a problem with the phone received by me. The instrument used to go off on its own. In order to restart the instrument had to remove and put back the battery. Not a reflection on the vendor, may have been a defective piece from the manufacturer.
Hardware is good. But the O.S lags a lot. Take at least a minute to open the contacts and other apps. Really disappointed.
Don't buy it phone is very slow it take time to make a call.network issue. Hangs a lot.lenovo service is very worst.
EXCELLENT MOBILE. WORTH FOR MONEY. BUT ONLY USED FOR RELIANCE CDMA NETWORK. OTHER CDMA NETWORK IS NOT WORK.
