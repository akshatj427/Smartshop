Got some extra money to spend on crap ??? Buy this phone....Stupid Phone ! Hardware Quality :: i bought it 1 year ago. i had to send it for repairing more than 6 times in one year. so i probably used it just for 6 months only. Battery Life :: it has the worst battery life. even if you charge it to 100%, it wont run more than 6 hours. moreover it heats up fast so the battery dies even faster. Processor :: the processor is not so good & its get hanged if more than 3 applications are active at a time. internal memory is so less ( 200 MB ) that even if you install few applications, it gets full. Supports external installation but even then you fall out of memory....... Camera :: Camera ??? what a joke ? you wont find a worser competition !! lolz Software Quality :: most low quality devices like these pretend that they run Android OS but they don't ! Shocked ? actually these are Spreadtrum phones that run a chinese modification of Android OS. they are highly unstable & will crash often. most applications dont run on these OS. these are the toughest phones to root.... Please dont spend your hard earned money on such stupid gadgets....
after one month of use it start hanging no service center resolved my issue service center has taken mob. For one and a half month and when i got back my phone the issue was not resolved and one another problem started of camera not working and low disk space
good looking,big touch screen and all futures are available in this phone. Prize is very terminable as compare to another phone but camera quality is low.
It is a very good mobile to use in the latest version of android, I purchased for my sister, she told it is very good her friend like a lot.
good
