I bought this for tethering purpose in foreign country. As tethering equipment, it's little bit big but also works as smartphone of course in emergency. As smartphone, its design and spec. is old so that it is dull processing and thicker compared with latest. However this is suitable for my purpose and cheap enough. it's good deal.
I was looking for Handy Branded Android Phone with decent touch and display features at affordable pricing. Tipo is perfect in those aspects but cannot be compared with other phones with slightly higher pricing which offers more value. Sound and call quality is very good. Recommend for basic mobile usage.
better phones in the market than this poor performance phone by sony>>>>>>>duuh!!
Did not match expectations. Touch screen is bad - need to restart the phone once every day, as it hangs often.
Superb, performance is good, happy shopping with amazon
