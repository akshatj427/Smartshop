its just a decent phone bearing samsung brand. But the screen is really dissapointing and the interface more complicated. So, if you are fond of a good screen then try other option.
I am using it...wrost phone of samsung..too much slow..screen size small..batery backup bad..camera avarege..music quality...gaming is slow.. .dont buy it
Really this phone is amazing.i used about 2 year.........cool and useful
no auto call record else good and two sims are mini, so difficult
