Those stars are for Amazon.. Thank you for delivering me before expected date.. About the phone: if you are looking for a phone with good display don't count on this phone. It has a poor display. Except display this phone has everything.
i'm giving it 3 star because you cant move your app on Memory Card camera :- works good during day time but it is no so good during night time front camera really poor Battery :- can't play games or run apps for long time battery get down very fast Games :- I saw 1 GB ram and thought it will give me good experience in game but getting lag in small games like subway surfers, temple run etc so you cant play big games on this In build Memory :- we get less then 2 GB to use can't install big apps it gets full very fast and can't change the camera and video store location to SD card so we are not able to record HD videos for long time Hope so this will help you guys
