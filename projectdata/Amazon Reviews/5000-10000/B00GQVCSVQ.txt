Because there is no IEM number in the invoice bill. Without the same the service centre is not consider for warrenty. At the same time I have faced a problem karbonn A 21+ and it is yet to solved due to non availability of warrenty. Kindly send the bill with IEM number.
Worst thing it's is hanging because if it's processor.
