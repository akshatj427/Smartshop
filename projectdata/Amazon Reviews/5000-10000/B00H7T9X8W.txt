It is a waste purchase. The mobile lacks everything and more over the dealer mirchi mart have a poor team, I was a given a damaged earphone and they denied to replace the same. Amazon has cheated me for the same, I am furious about Amazon and henceforth I will not buy anything from Amazon. If you do really care about customer please take back the mobile and refund half the money, I would be happy with it.
1. Camera clarity very poor 2. support only 2g network...not 3g.. 3. heating issue when using camera or recording video or playing video 4. sound quality poor.. 5. hanging problem when you have many apps installed overall rating should be 0.5 / 5...worst phone ever....!!
Nice phone
looks good. fantastic delivery from Amazon. Probably trying to get rid of the stocks. 8mp camera pictures are horrible. Audio worst. better for amazon not to promote these type of companies and worthless products. one more electronic junk in the showcase.
Okay
