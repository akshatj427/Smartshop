All the way problems.... screen black out after few seconds... there's a thick line appearing on screen... this problem starts after 4 days of my purchase. Kindly tell where to report and get it replaced as there's no replace policy or exchange policy described.
Mobile is good but after sales service is too bad by karbonn. Karbonn's customer care number is ALWAYS BUSY. if you are lucky you can talk to its customer care in 7-8 days. My a29's touch got faulty and it is in service center more than 40 days. Instead of buying Karbonn crap throw your money.
This product seems like a failure. Its touch stopped working after almost a month. first the Left touch button failed, then the right one. now the complete touch screen has stopped working. on top of that the battery never stays for more then 3-4 hours. Disappointed with Karbonn.. Same was the case with my Karbonn A7* that i bought 6 months back. Exactly the same problem. I thought may be it was my bad luck and thought of buying another Karbonn. but now i have made a final decision and would suggest others as well to stay away from karbonn.
Dont Buy Any Karboon Mobile they r wast of Mony & Time

Phone is good but battery being 2000 mah is very bad, it don't even last 4-5 hours of continuous usage. karbonn should think about this. also phone gets heated near camera. Overall good experience.
