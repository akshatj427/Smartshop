Awsome mobile in such a low price from a brand like samsung.The looks in just stunning. Very happy with the product.
Galaxy Star Pro is an upgrade to Samsung's Galaxy star. This is a budget device,so as you can expect it comes with a lot of flows. Features 1) Single core,Cortex-A5 1Ghz processor 2) 512 MB Ram 3) 1500mAh Battery 4) 4 inch TFT screen,480x800 resolution. 5) Jellybean 6) 2 MP camera - Image quality is below average. Main issues you are gonna face with this phone - Processing Power and Battery. This device only has Cortex-A5 Single Core processor which is very outdated,and very basic. Dont expect to get good gaming experience with this device at all. Battery,1500mAh one, cant even last one full day of average usage. Buy this only if you want a branded budget phone. But beware,this thing is gonna hang and lag often while multitasking and opening apps due to a very low end processor it ships with.
