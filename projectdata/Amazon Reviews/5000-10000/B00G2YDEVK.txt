Samsung continues to exploit their brand name by introducing very low end devices for a higher price. This phone is clearly overprized. The performance of the device is not good at all. 1 Ghz single core processor is not enough to handle multi-tasking with ease and the heavy touchwiz ui makes things worse. This only has 512MB of Ram. The battery backup is also not good,it can't even last a day of average use. * * Specs * * 1 Ghz Single core processor. 512 MB Ram 480 x 800 pixels, 4.0 inches TFT Display Android Jellybean,with Touchwiz interface on top. 3 MP Camera [ Poor Quality ], NO front camera. 1500mAh Battery My recommendation is to pay a few more bucks and go for quadcore,1GB Ram devices like Xolo Q700,Xolo Q700S etc coming under 10K. Galaxy Trend is clearly not a value for money device.
