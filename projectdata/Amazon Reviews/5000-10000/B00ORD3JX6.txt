Thats perhaps the best phone available in this price range. Better than android one phones in each n every aspect, except the camera. Cons it lacks autofocus and front camera is only vga. Battery back up fpr this price range is very nice. Antutu score of my phone 18800+ I got it locally from Chandigarh I did not like redmi 1s + this phone guarantees android L for sure. So go for it without even a single thought You wont regret buying this. Heavy games work fine without lag But for heavy camera users, its no. Briefly a very smart feature loaded phone Overall very satisfied with phone
Pros good display, good battery backup (depends on your usage), average camera, head phones are ok, very comfortable to hold in your hands, almost looks like a premium phone within 5.5k (not bad at all ), processor is awesome, this phone can play almost any game in the play store ( Trust me, i am a gamer ), you get 1.94 gb of internal memory after you update to lolly pop. Cons speakers and front camera are not that good.
Had purchased this phone for my mom after extensive online research but sadly it did not turned upto my expectation. There is a heavy heating problem on the phone after simple task like calling. (after a 4-5 mins call you can use it as hot massage bar.) If this issue is resolved then this phone can be my choice again. Rest all the features are awesome.
Awesome phone fitds in everyone's budget .. If u r thinking of buying a phone under 6ooors then this phone suits you ... FAst processor and preinstalled android lollipop version.... That s all we need !!
It fullfills my expectations ...good performance ..nice camera clearity and features of android lollypop is also nice.. In mid range price its a perfect mobile . Delivery is very fast and packing is also impressive
This mobile is working good, coming to speakers, externally they are not working properly, less volume & buzz sound is coming, when I keep high volume. Remaining every thing is good. Weight less, fast working, looks smartly.
Nice Future for this range camera result also good very hug apps stored and 8 gb internal memory its good cell phone and latest up gradable this system nice performance enjoyyyyyyyyy with XOLO One
I am a certified buyer , it's a good phone comprising all features uptill , and phone quality is good too
Its a super cheapest smart phone/I'll give 4 star.1GB RAM & 8 GB ROM. Super camera picture quality but Video Picture quality is not good.
Very Good Product in this price - I analyzed the market ,In this price range, There is no other device as good as Xolo One
Xolo is an AndroidOne partner, but Xolo One is NOT an AndroidOne device, even though it has almost the same specs as those Android One devices from Micromax,Karbonn and Spice. Performance : Quadcore Mt6582m is more than enough for your daily day to day tasks. You can even play many of the popular games without much issues. Software: Xolo has released an Android Lollipop update ( Jan 16th ) for this device which is great considering official AndroidOne devices supported by Google are yet to get this update.Advantage AndroidOne devices have over this is that they will get software updates for 2 years or so from Google while support for Xolo One ends with Android L update. Camera: As you can expect in a Budget device like this, Average. Battery: 1700mAh, not enough if you use 3G data a lot. AndroidOne devices have the same capacity battery. This won't last one day of moderate usage with 3G on. Xolo One vs AndroidOne Even though Xolo One got Android L update before Android devices,support for this device ends there, while AndroidOne devices will get updates for another 18months or so. One advantage Xolo One has over AndroidOne devices is, it has better build quality. It comes with a Leather back and looks better overall.
Its amazing phone.... Realy good. No comment 4 this phone...
Nice set. Slim, sexy. Good one as per price.
Value for money product. Recommend for all
good, but battery gets heatup fast.
Verry nice phone:-)paisavasool :-)
This is d best phone in dis price range. Some websites like ebey, snapdeal etc are selling it in aroud 5.5k n u can also apply some coupons on them, then it will cost u around 5k only. First thing to be noted that Xolo-One is not an Android-one set which means u will not get the android updates for 2 years like other Android-one mobiles. Good thing is that Xolo has released "Lollipop 5.0" update (557.8 Mb) on 16th Jan, 2015 which has amazing & mind-blowing features. I am d first one in my city to have it in my mobile (yippee). All d Android-One users are still having "baba ji ka thullu". Camera is not good due to lack of Auto-focus but video capturing is just amazing. Next gud thing about Xolo One is both d sim slots are 3g. So we can use 3g service on either of d sims. Battery performance is excellent in 2G mode but with 3G mode u hv to be careful. Most crucial difference is in d " Looks", Xolo-One has no comparison with any Android-One sets. I just fall in love with it in a single look, it is just sexy. All d other Android-One sets from Micromax, spice, n Karbonn are bull-s*** in looks. My final verdict, go for Xolo-One in 5.5K range.
***** excellent phone when it runs KitKat ***** Please consider the following facts before upgrading it to lollipop, 1. 1700mah gives less than 8 hrs on moderate use after the upgrade 2. heating issue after the upgrade 3. ringing is not continuous, there is an issue after the upgrade 4. Lollipop, which is still an half cooked rom with lots of flaws, 5. Headset issue after the lollipop upgrade ********** THIS IS NOT ANDROID ONE PHONE **********
Pros. For this cost range The processor Touch Design Speaker Coins Heavy heating Battery drain is very rapid Camera is not up to mark My say.. The phone is good by practically of no use since the battery drains completely within hours.... And the heating is very high ... Not able to receive calls due heavy heating...ear litteraly burns.. So I suppose a phone with such a low battery is practically of no use
