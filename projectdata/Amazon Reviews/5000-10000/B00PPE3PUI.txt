Iball 4u frisbee is right choise to normal user by android os. Which means if you are harcore games fan then please don't choose this one. Because this smartphone run smoothly these type of games like eg: Subway Surfers, candy crush, temple run, etc. Not recommened for big games by this one like san andreas mobile, real racing, etc. So, if you r a normal user then go to buy this one. Its a right choice. WhatsApp, fb, chatting, browsing, playing movies, etc. Pros:- +Very smooth touch (very sensitve) +Lightweight (easly to handle) + Not worry for if your handset is dropdown at couple of time. The handset's body and battery are ejected when the product is dropped down from you. + Good speed +Good Camera +Good sound clarity +Accessories have build quality like earphone, charger. Cons:- I saw the one disadvantage is this mobile. Battery backup. But it doesn't matter for android phones especially kitkat devices are there have common issue. But standby and normal call and sms usage at rare internet use or social mesaaging have a good battery backup. Verdict: If you r looking an android device with normal usage then go for it and its have many advanced featres like gorilla glass, etc. At 5k budget is a right choice, don' choose xolo one and micromax canvas fire.
nice look. good camara. light weight......good
