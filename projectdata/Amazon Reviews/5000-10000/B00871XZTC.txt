BB Curve is a fitting business phone - outstanding from the bulk of 'smart' phones. With its excellent keyboard, easy handling and useful software I'm happy to have it,
1 year usage review. Excellent phone for the price bracket. Cons: Battery problem that all Blackberry users seem to be having (frequent auto reboot once the battery % falls below the 50-60% life). This will frustrate you beyond your imagination and particularly when you need it the most (urgent call, show a ticket to train TTE or airline security, get directions...)
The charger does not work I am using my old charger the battery does notlast the day not half as much asd my old curve this is my first online purchase and I have no clue how to handle the problem
needs too much extra effort to run and does not have much support. Needs special internet packs and does not justify the cost. I had to return it.
Very good
Comfortable for typing and phone calls
Good One.. Good Service...
one of the best item.
awsome
