Camera very bad. But perfomens gud
This mobile is very good..easy to use and good battery backup...it lasts a day for me even i was using it continuously......
Wonderful handset....
This mobile is giving more than its paid for. Compared to all other smartphones in the market it's the best cellphone. The problems arising are that it gets hot very soon during calltime and due to pressure application it gets switched off by itself. It is meant for everyone as it inculcates all required necessities within itself to cater to everyine's needs.
