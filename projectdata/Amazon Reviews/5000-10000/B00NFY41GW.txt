B00NFY41GW
Best mobile.with 16 mp and 8 mp camera...16 GB storage...1.7 GHz 2 GB Ram....very very reasonable and best compared to Samsung sony
The description dose not matches with the phone as it is written 16mp camera but in the phone there is upto 12mp....while playing games sometimes it stops....internal memory we get 10gb remaining is occupied by the system os & inbuilt apps....battery is very poor compared to any cheap android phones....Its not what i expected
Was not given wat we have ordered for...the phone which we have ordered has 16megapixel camera and 16 internal storage but we received 12 megapixel and 8gb internal memory
This product is good but very delicate to handle. It fell down twice and it has got minor dent. The features are awesome.
Money worth
Very brust product and service is not good
Must be com
very good
really nice mobile......
Discription details and feature details mix match what is the reality of this phone
worst product... i want to return it...
overall phone is good except one issue that i am not able to use total 16 GB internal storage of phone means
