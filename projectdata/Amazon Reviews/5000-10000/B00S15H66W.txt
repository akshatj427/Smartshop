B00S15H66W
Good phone Decent battery life General note, Sadly Samsung has never found it important to give their phones a makeover in the looks segment! Depressing look!
i have purchased this phone 45 days before it often hangs and smetime it shows slow performance so kindly exchange my phone.....
For this price I can give you a 3 star. Because of 8 GB storage, 5 MP Camera, 1 GB Ram.and 4.5 " screen. Cons: Worst display. No touch key lights. It is always off, and no setting available. You can't make folder in application panel. and a biggest joke : When you dial a call or when you receive an incoming call, don't touch the "recent apps button" . It will make your calling screen to vanish !!!!! If you want to bring it again, you have to slide the home screen down and tap on the icon . I found it really funny for a "SMART" phone...!!!!!.
Good and new product, as described. Price should have been more competitive with that of other online stores.

Budget mobile in samsung..
Good performance, Slim,Light weight, Good Battery life. A good product from samsung under 10,000rs. Only issue was that the ear phones were white but I'm not sure whether all the mobiles do come in with white earphones as observed lot of people carrying white with black. Pakaging was small and well packed.
