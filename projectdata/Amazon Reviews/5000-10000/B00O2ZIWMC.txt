a good phone for the price which I bought at Big Bazar during Dassera. Quality of camera is good. Too early to comment.
The phone is worth buying.. But the flash is disappointing
value for money. but grammer typing is not enabled
This is the worst phone i ever bought
How much mAh battery of this phone?
OK
