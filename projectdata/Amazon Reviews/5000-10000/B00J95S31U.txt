It's very good mobile for this price. Photos and videos are very good. Only concern is video files can't be uploaded thru what'sUP.
Its a good phone. Im using this phone past one month. Battery is working as per the expectation. Best phone in this range.
5-inch is not my preference, I play games but not much. I wanted phone which could fit in my hand and pocket (between 4-4.5 inch) with better camera quality I saw a lot of reviews on mmx A114, Samsung Duos 2, Moto E but eventually stuck to P3. This is a wonderful phone for just 6.6K, screnn size of 4.3" is still quite big enough to hadrly fit in hand, camera quality is much better even in pitch dark room with flash and outdoors (natural colors, no yello or blue tings). There is no OTG in this phone, can not expect in 6.6K and what I am onserving is quite low sound in headphones, though adequate but could hv been better.
all are ok..but try to reduce SAR value
