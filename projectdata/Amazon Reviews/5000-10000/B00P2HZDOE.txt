Another amazing phone from Micromax. If you are looking for a Phablet in this range, then you have come to the right place. This phone is just wow. Now I'll discuss some of the basic features of this Phone. 1. Screen Screen size is 6.0" (maximum) in the phablet range. Yeah, it's quite big screen. Resolution is 854Ã—480 with 167 ppi. You'll think that the display may be pixelating, but it is not so. Screen is pretty good and there is no sign of pixelation. Look wise, it seems great. It is slim too ( 9 mm approx ). 2. Camera Camera is really decent of this phone. It's 5MP auto focus camera (with HDR mode, Panorama Mode and Smile Shot). Color reproduction was absolute. It can record 720p videos upto 30 fps. You can't get a better camera in this range (unite 2 , fire 2 cameras are almost of the same quality, but still i'll place them above this phone in camera quality. Still the camera quality is much better than Karbonn or Lava Phones of the same range). 3. Speaker Speaker is not that great. Sound gets muffled a bit. But the headphones provided are really good. 4. Memory With 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB ROM, you can't expect more in this price range. You'll get 4.68 GB as the internal storage while 1.27 GB for apps installation. Apps can be moved to external storage. 5. Processor It has 1.3 GHz dual core processor. They should have provided a quad core processor but still for normal usage you won't find any lag. 6. Battery Battery is quite good. It has 2500 mAH battery, which gives you a good backup for almost a full day, under normal usage and 7-8 hours under heavy usage. You get Android Kitkat 4.4.2 right out of the box. It has a notification led. It has got smart flip cover with it in the box. I was able to play heavy games like frontline commando and vice city on my phone. If you are not a heavy gamer, I'll recommend this phone. Attaching a few pics taken in Normal, HDR mode in low light (without flash) and in no light (with flash). I bought this phone and I am not disappointed.
Genuine Product and Quick shipping...Big Screen and worth the price..
Camera is 4mp quite good in day light only, overall A102 is much better than other same range cell phones. for gaming is good. for watching videos very good. for photography average for music good. sim one (1) 3g sim two (2) GSM only 3g not supported battery 4 - 5 hrs on continues use stand by 8-12hrs no compass sensor is in built price range 6100INR - 6300INR DONT THINK.....JUST BUY IT
Nice phone! but did you people get a memory card with the package??
Can not install that much application which can be installed in another product like Unite2. When I run the flash application it hangs, i have to remove the battery and I just uninstalled that app. If you want a bigger device than only go for it, else go for other products.
it's good i'm happy by owning this product...

Great piece! However, I need a spare battery. Even a couple of batteries will not suffice.
