i baught it today not frm flipkart from a shop in kolkata at 8500.. the only 2 bad things i found are: 1)both the front and secondary camera is bad ... 2)low internal memory storgae for apps
Bought this handset on 15th April and technical problem found on 17th April.It is not getting started.Service center told me it will take 10 days to repair.Worst product.Don't buy...
very bad.. dnt buy it i got an defective one ..... it is nt switching on ..... waste of money and now because of ths experience of flipkart i cnt buy any other product from here........ bad screen worst camera .....
On the first day of delivery itself the phone made crackling sounds and screen flickered shut. My sim was wet from the inside when i removed it after all of this. Found a couple of dents on the side of the back cover too. Hopefully it will get replaced...Bad first experience of this retailer.
great product guys be proud and buy instead buying foriegn products like smsng. good phone overall all features working great good value for money.....
