Coll Stuff. If u r thinking to buy a phone at an range of 13k then get this one its an awesome phone as compared to samsung s 3 Its really rocks :)
Hey friend I bought this phone few months. Excellent performance better than some Samsung Galaxies phones in this price range. but this phone internal memory is only 1.5gb so I want to complain Amazon customer service. Update this phone details and write true details this phone and all phones.
lg L70 low cost and high performance super touch performance, camera also so good.better then Moto G.
Never thought a smart phone with front cam will not support a video call by carrier. Screen response time on double tap is very slow when I compared with an lower end Nokia Lumia. Software is little slow but full with features. Over all satisfactory.
A good value for money product. Though its being new in market and just launched much accessories like Flip Case etc are not available.
Very poor...internal.memmory is very low..applications are not downloaded buckwaass ....not choose this one..
The LG l70 is nice smart phone it works very fast android and just problem is bratty back up is not
good
