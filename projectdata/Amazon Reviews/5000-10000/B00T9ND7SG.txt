Its a gud fone... but has some demerits *HSPA(3g) not working *after switching off the net for 1hr or more, the net doesnt work... have to remove the sim then insert it. *screen touch not working sometimes
It's a good phone, but the display is not up to the standard! Quite satisfied with the hardware specifications. But, I like Nokia Lumia phones than Microsoft Lumia phones.
Excellent build. Performance is also good. Windows 8.1 is a big improvement over earlier versions. In all a very good value for money product. Strongly recommended.
Nice Basic Phone, truly satisfied with it
Totally worth the money.
