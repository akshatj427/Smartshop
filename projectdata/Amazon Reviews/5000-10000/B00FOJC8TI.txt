I had purchased Panasonic against all advices from friends and family. I ilked the feature, it has everything I wanted and price was very reasonable. But just within two months it got display problem. Nothing was visible on screen. When given to service centre in Borivali (Java Telecom) they said it will take 25 days to repair it. I asked for replacement, but they denied. When i received my phone from service centre, display was repaired but it got sound problem which was not there earlier. I could not hear anything. I had give it back to service centre. They repaired it. After 8 days it again got sound problem. The voice was not clear. So I called Panasonic cutomer care and told them everything that happened and requested for replacement. Customer care simply denied the replacement and diverted me to service centre. Service centre had already denied replacement. So now I have to survive with faulty phone or buy new one. Overall very bad experience with phone and also panasonic after sales team Not recommended to buy (Zero star is not allowed in Amazon, otherwise I would given that)
Ease in Setup and Good performance. It's one of the best budget phone. Betterment needed in Camera HD recording & Battery backup.
A VERY CUTE AND AFFORDABLE PHONE.ENOUGH FEATURES AND UNBELIEVABLE SPEED PROCESSOR FOR GAMES. A MONEY'S WORTH PRODUCT.ALSO AMAZON'S AMAZING AND QUICK DELIVERY.
light weight ..very slim....looks perfect....very comfortable in hand....1gb ram (the best think m getting under 10K).....the performance of battery+camera is not as per expectation....but overall nice phone
Good hand set
