It Looks pretty smart,Inspired to buy due to its hardware specifications,software up gradation availability ,price tag ,and reading the reviews from flipkart,Finally after 15 days of use come to say its ok to have it . Pros It runs smoothly the games like subway surf,temple run due to its amazing hardware battery runs one day completely for normal use it looks premium Cons sometimes It crashes automatically during phone calls Heats up during the heavy Net use or Game playing Considering the cons..! I think for price upto 6k its ok to have..!!
The phone is not worthy at all. Problem with sound, bad viewing angle, no loudspeaker fregile body. Although economical but no long term gain...
Super happy with my New Lava Iris 406 Q. This is my first smart phone and couldn’t have hoped for better features than this one. Superb specs in affordable price that’s why I love Lava so much. Great phone. 5 stars
phone is fast enough for daily usage but its mike is bit poor need to speak loader so that person on other end could hear properly.
the phone is ok. However, it gets hot withing 1/2 minute call. Can anybody suggest, how to get rid of this.
if u want to waste your money than buy this phone .completly useless ,no battery ,hanging all the time
Just a waste of money
Sooo Hot
