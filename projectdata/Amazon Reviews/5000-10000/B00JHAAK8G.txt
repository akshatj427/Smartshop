I bought Sony Xperia E1 Dual yesterday. I got free Sony Head phone(1390 INR) along with ear phone which makes happy! I updated software. I did not face any issue so far. It is actually nice feeling to operate,4‚Äù big display and best sound quality which attracts much. it is very cheap and best mobile in this price range Guys who is planning to buy 7500 INR, please choose this phone. Only thing is 512MB RAM which makes disadvantage for heavy games Camera is 3.15 MP is also basically OK (without flash) for this price but that depends on usage of person
Very bad exp.phn gettng restarted three to more times and also voice getting hanged inturrepted and cut while talking o speaking on call.
Product delivered in 9 days. Not delivery at home, salesmen was called me at collect phone. Very bad exp.phn getting restarted three to more times and also voice getting hanged interrupted and cut while talking o speaking on call.
Cheap in comparison and awesome sound quality. Reliable and strong. Good and perfect for rough use but scratches fall too soon.... That's the only disappointment.
