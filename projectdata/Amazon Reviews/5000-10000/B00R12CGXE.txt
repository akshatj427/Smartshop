Delivery by Amazon is very prompt, as usual. For a couple of days, earpiece volume was low. But after that it had become normal and now the volume is clear. Ringtones are not usually loud. If you choose a loud ringtone. then it will be okay. The quality of camera is excellent. Initially the battery was draining fast. After installation of power saving apps like batter doctor and cm cleaner, it has also become improved. My overall review is "This phone is good"
Nice phone in these categories... i m also bought from showroom. Best one is the RAM and ROM are very good .maximum application supported. I like it.
My friend totally loved it. It was a great gift for her 20th Birthday. She is really enjoying it's features. . .
