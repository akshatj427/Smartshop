Good mobile in its own price. Quickly charges the battery and draines slowly, this feature i like most. I did not found such features so far i had mobile phones.
I got delivered on 7th may 15'......touch is great....Looks is good.... Processor is also good but camera and flash is dissatisfactory.....
