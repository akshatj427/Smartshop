awesome phone the best from nokia dont think anything and buy it first thing that it runs with android 4.3 the camera quality is superb after update it supports some google services
For who love in Nokia.. Previous Nokia x series mobiles are not upto that mark.. But this one prove what Nokia can afford for the price we given.. The only con I think is backlight for navigation key, surely an cost cutting.. Anyway the product is surely an value for money.. They improved lot from previous version.. The a mobile is not like basic Android, ui is simply awesome.. For the price we paid cameras is awesome..
