Lenovo A850 is a mid range quadcore device priced around 15K Features,Pros and Cons 1) 5.5 inch IPS Display,but coming with a poor resolution (540 x 960 pixels ) ie only 200PPI. Viewing angles are good though. 2) This is powered by a MTK 6582M Quad-core 1.3GHz Processor which performs on par with the popular Mtk6589 processor. The GPU on board is a Mali-400 MP. It performs better than the usual GPU, PowerVR SGX 544MP, seen in mtk6589 devices like Micromax Turbo,Xolo 3000 etc.Gaming performance is great for the price. (Note : GSMArena lists this has a PowerVR SGX 544MP GPU which is an error, gfxbenchmark website clearly shows it has a Mali-400 MP ) 3) 1 GB Ram, which has now become a standard in 10K+ devices, allows lag free multitasking. 4) Jellybean 4.2.2 - Not the latest,but still new and better than 4.1 Jellybean. Im not sure whether this device will ever get updates to 4.3 or 4.4. No word from lenovo yet. Like any other Lenovo device,this too has a modified custom ui,so not a stock android experience. 5) Battery - Li-Po 2250 mAh battery which is good. You can get around 2 days of average use with low brightness settings. 6) Camera - 5 MP Rear and VGA Front Cam. Photo quality is not good. 7) Storage - You CANNOT move or install apps to the sdcard,so you are stuck with around 2 GB of internal memory for apps and games installation,which is not enough if you plan to install a lot of games. Overall a good huge device with decent specs,but priced a little higher. Camera quality and Internal memory are the key downsides of this device.

I purchased this product a couple of days back from a local shop in the exchange for my previous Galaxy Nexus, which i had to change because of the battery backup. I had to stick to a tight budget of 15k so i brought this piece and so far I am really happy with it. The pros and cons are as follow: PROS: 1) The looks of the phone are very good. 2) The built quality is superb, overall the looks and the built makes it a premium device, so no doubt there. 3) The screen is big i.e 5.5 inches. Surprisingly big for this price range. 4) The Mediatek MTK 6582M at 1.3 GHz performs too good. Beats all phones in below 20k range and some above 20k too, for eg: like Galaxy Grand(both), Mega 5.8, Sony Xperia C etc and i guess it equals Xperia SP. Mediatek MTK 6582M performs better than MTK 6589 and even MTK 6589T and hence beats all Mediatek powered local brand phones. 5) Benchmarks: Antutu - ( 17,100), Quadrant - (6001) and Nenamark - (full 60fps) which is amazing. 6) GPU is Mali-400MP2 which is certainly better than Power VR SGX544 which is almost in all local mediatek powered phones. 6) RAM is 1 GB out of which you get 972 MB usable which is excellent. There is well more than 600 MB RAM free before installing apps. 7) Dual sim. 8) Sound is very loud and good. Not excellently clear but very load and reasonably clear and definitely audible. 9) In-call volume and clarity is good. 10) Music quality in my headphones is good. I haven't tested the stock headphones. 11) Comes with android 4.2.2 installed. 12) Memory can be expanded to 32 GB via micro sd card. 13) Nice and clearly visible notification LED. 14) Lenovo launcher is highly customizable. 15) Pricing is very very good. NEUTRAL POINTS: 1) Battery is good but not excellent. I feel Lenovo made a mistake by giving only 2250 mAh battery to power such a huge screen. It should have been atleast 2500 mAh; but nonetheless it still gives me a good 24 hours of battery life with 3G always on and mild - moderate usage. Should definitely last u through workday hours i.e from morning 10 to evening 8 or something with moderate usage. Ultimately this depends on user to user. One can use the provided Lenovo power app to maximize the battery life. 2) The speaker's loudness sometimes tears the voice. 3) The speaker at times gets covered by surfaces and blocks the sound. I would blame the design of the phones for this. 4) Awkward positioning of buttons. Power button on top and volume button on the right. 5) Its fairly long time since 4.3 has released Lenovo should give it out to its customers now. This should have come with it. CONS: 1) Camera is not good at all. Lens is not upto the mark. Bad decision of giving only 5mp of camera in these days..seriously who gives 5mp of camera nowadays!? Front camera is just VGA. Should haven been atleast 8mp rear and 1.3 mp on the front. 2) Too big, Its very very big. A screen of 5 inches or even 5.3 inches like that of S920 would have been better. 3) Resolution is bad for this screen size. As is said in the previous point a screen of 5 inches with this resolution would have been better. 4) Internal memory is just 4 GB out of which you get 2.07 GB for use. I don't like this trend of giving just 4 GB of internal memory. Its too less for installing apps. Moreover you can't transfer apps to your sd card, so you are stuck with 2.07 GB of space for apps unless you root. Should have been atleast 8 GB of internal storage. 5) No Gorilla glass. Deducting one star for battery capacity and all cons. VERDICT: A nice tight budget phone with hefty performance and reasonably good battery life(which could have been better). If you are on a budget of less than 17k then you should definitely close your eyes and go for it. For brand freaks, Lenovo is a good reputable brand which you can trust on.
I am using this mobile for last 1 month. Found excellent in both mobile as well as the seller. Out of all, Battery is nice: which last for more than 24hrs with 3g / 40hrs with 2g Thanks,

In short, it is a steal if one has to weigh price vs product. Have been using for a few weeks now and have not fallen short of nothing. It did not make me feel like wish it had this and that. You name it this has it. Touch, camera, media, display, ...are od mind blowing quality. Lenovo i guess only falls short in creating hype like competition does. Its a hidden treasure. Highly recommend. Just that hard covers are hard to find in the market. Good if lenovo adds it to the package.
Nice buy for the price it is being offered. Large Screen Size, high processor speed, decent RAM. In short a phone with features of 15+ K what Samsung, Sony are offering. No issues with usage. Cons: Internal memory too low (only 2.1 GB against advertised 4 GB). Back side plastic appears delicate and somewhat cheap.
Pros Fast Con's 1. Big size makes difficult while riding on bikes 2. Low internal memory, just 2gb 3 no OTG support.
Amazing amazon..quick delivery...best and affordable price. Mobile is working like a gem. Top features as compared to other costly phones in market.
They claim its a 4 GB internal memory but actually it is just 2 GB internal memory and also they say it is having 3G connectivity but even this is a false claim, have only 2G. Very dissappointed with this.
This phone is really smart, 90% satisfied with it only problem is the battery backup which can be lmprooved.otherwise its a good phone
This phone has all the features at this range, but the only problem is the default install location. It installs directly into the internal storage. But other than that it is a wonderful piece and battery backup is great and processor is very fast as compared to other devices. Which makes the apps to run smoothly and games to run without any latches. overall it is very good phone.
great product in this range, i bought it at 9800. pros: 1. big screen (5.5) 2. Decent display 3. Good battery backup cons: 1. audio is low overall its a good product in this price range
This product is the best value for money. It performs very well in normal condition. Even it lets me to play asphalt without any lag. This game came in the device and got installed after inserting the sd card. After using for some time, I couldn't find any issue with the low pixel density. Now I love this product very much.
It is a very good phone with lot of lovely features in an economical budget. Overall it is a great. but the quality of Camera is not good

Its very nice Phone to use all the application. very good
Seems good!!! Nice delivery...
All over a good phone.
Happy to having it
Fantastic
So cute
The above mentioned Cell phone was taken by me in last month, but the quality of Camera (5MP) is very bad, as like as 1 MP/2MP only. But the same cell phone was purchased by my friend from the mobile store and quality of Camera is very good also the clarity of my phone and other things are on very lower side. So request you to think twice for purchase of phone from online site.
