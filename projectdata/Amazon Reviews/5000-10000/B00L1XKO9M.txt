Its an awesome phone. The only demerit i have found is that its available internal memory is only 1.5gb
I have earlier used a cheaper phone of samsung touch and type. However the internet experience on this device has been much better than on LG L80
Superb phone!! Using it for the last 3 months. No issues at all.. Only problem is that the internal memory is 1.5 GB.
