This octacore phone was required for my professional reasons and I tried it will full throttle and it dint put my investment to shame. The only issue was RAm sometime and battery lasted for almost 20 hours of heavy usage. The display screen was very good and I personally din have any complaints. The antutu score was good for this phone hence I went for this one. I used 64GB expansion memory and it worked fine.
