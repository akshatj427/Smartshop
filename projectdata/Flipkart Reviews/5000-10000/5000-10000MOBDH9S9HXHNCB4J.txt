I ha I have been Flipkart's customer past two years and I don't have any complaints/regrets regarding their services. Coming on to point,review about this product- after using for 17days I can say it is absolutely great product launched by LG.No lag or hangups. Touch response is good.Voice quality of head phones is good. Picture clarity is superb. I usually use wifi all time n play Subway n Temple run bike racing games...but still battery life is good. If you are looking for good Jellybean phone its this one to go with.
After lot of search I purchased this mobile for my wife. mobile slim in size. 4 inch screen sufficient for use. easy to handle. operating speed is very good. this phone has very good features. battery life also good. IPS display rocks....!!! LG has done very good job.
Did some heavy research on all phones between 10 k - 20k, some really nice phone, however, regardless of samsung, sony micromax HTC, all had some major issues. Either battery back up, lagging, heating up etc No point spending 13 - 15 k or upto 20k and have so many issues. So stumbled upon this one, and was impressed by its simplicity, classy design and the Low pricing. Bought this from a Mobile shop near my house, got it for 10k flat, with a free jelly case(awesome quality) and a screen guard. Comes with a charger and a USB cable, in ear head phones.. fairly decent quality. Yes it does have a single core, and only 512 Mb Ram, but what the heck... Its more than enough for Fb, whats app, instagram , twitter, temple run, 8 ball pool and email. May be not for Gamers, but more than sufficient. Its a Phone for godsake. Meant to used for calls, messaging and email. Screen clarity is good, smooth touch experience. No lag if you do not fill your phone with unwanted apps. I have installed all the necessary apps, anti virus, Ram cleaner, bass boost, and the ones I mentioned before. Not to forget the pre-installed apps from LG, like talk, chrome.. etc etc So if you are satisfied with your life, and do not need more than FB, whats app , and other basic games, this is the best budget phone. EMI option is even better, only 1666 per month for 6 months, Interest free So go for it use it for a year or so and surely there will be something better, cos the market is very competitive.
its the best in its price category, u getting the lattest android os (jellybean)..and specification which is not so bad either..it is something what you pay and you get littel more.. & would like to mention the new LED notification which is very eye-catchy.. a complete worthy phone,! you will be satisfied with it.. for how much you are paying for it..
The first thing i want to Inform everyone about it is that it does not have minisim but normal sim. Now The points where it scores over other phones are 1. Light weight and good resolution. 2. The processor does not lag or hangup. 3. Good battery life and good resolution. 4. Free case provided with phone else it was impossible to find good case. Cons. 1. No secondary camera. 2. Charger should be made better in quality. 3 Hard to find screen protector.
i brought this phone from univercell. phone frequently gets hang, back panel gets heated. worst phone till now.
If u just want to call and txt someone..then go for it...otherwise dont. switches off any time...restarts any time...home button stopped working,..cant even start chrome ,it shuts chrome automatically...my favourite game clash of clans,.runs for only 3 secs..then phone restarts....my network goes off after 1 or 2 hours...when i gave it to the service center they said...6000 rs ..even when it was in warranty...physical damage and all that shit...i took the phone and shunted it on the wall ....broke into 10 peices and then disposed it into the public severs... Plz...dont go for it.. Xolo , karbon are way much better than... Lg...

The phone has not given any problem for the past 6 months but it has slowed down. maybe because of the apps and games i have installed. cant complain. but lg doesnt have a good service center base here. That sucks for a multi billion dollar company. Thanks flipkart.
every thing is nice slim size No Issue But phone looks little bit differ as shown in the picture. Flipkart always good . . .
the phone is awesome i brought it half month back Pros good camera processor is fast no lags price cons non removable battery android version has to be improved i brought it for Rs.9200 from croma store. Flipkart shall reduce the price
Bought this phone recently for 8.9k from another site for my wife. My only complaint about this phone is that you can have significantly more VFM by adding 1k or 2k to your budget. Well I kindof knew that, but I had a bizarre requirement to get the camera removed from the mobile so that my wife could use it in her office premises. I tried reaching all the service centers and only LG answered my call and agreed to do this without disturbing the warranty. I eventually figured out that Samsung had the same terms for camera removal :( The phone has a good 4 inch screen, IPS display and a 1700 mah battery. This and LG's excellent track record -> product quality, service and s/w update support, would probably swing you to this over some of the chinese and indian brands that pack better hardware (read cpu, gpu and sometimes ram) and compromise on battery, display and support (imagine holding token number 80 at the Micromax service center waiting room, and hoping they will fix your funbook). Its got a decent Mediatek 1Ghz cpu 512kb cache typically outshining other equivalent single core cpu's. the gpu is old gen powervr 531 but with significantly higher clock speed. At the same time its got to be the slowest at the pricepoint; though i did not notice any obvious slowdowns. If you can spend a little more, consider the Xperia M or Galaxy Core. I'd think twice getting the S Duos - its got good hardware but awful battery support.
LG optimus L5 ll is a good phone at this price.All the basic smartphone facility is in it except it has not secondary camera.But except this,this phone will not put you in the thinking,why have I brought this?l have brought this phone on 28th August 2013,but till know after one month it's speed,functionality isn't decreased a little more.It has 720 playback also.So you may go for this smartphone at this price.
************************************************** I just loved the Phone Design...Thanks to LG It has all necessary things and i am not a 24hours phone freak.....so bought this Cons: You can not expect iPod quality audio but OK **************************************************
Pros: - Good display, IPS with good viewing angles. - Good Battery. - Decent GPU. - latest optimus UI with Quick memo feature. - Jelly bean 4.1.2 - Camera has auto focus with flash - Nice and good looking build. - LED Notifications - FM radio. Cons: - Sub par camera - no front facing camera. - Single core mediatek processor If you are fine with windows OS, you can go for Lumia 520 which is 1 k cheaper than this.
Basically. It's the best budget Android smartphone. It has the elegance, shape and feel of an expensive phone but the price of a midrange handset without missing out on key crucial features for the needy smartphone user of today.
This really is a brilliant performer. I bought the phone from another source and i am amazed by it. It scores great on performance, looks, touch sensitivity, loud speaker quality. Cam is great as well. With IPS touch screen, LG optimus L5 is definitely worth buying. I find it easy to handle it as well. Its not too small, so one can enjoy all functional aspects of a smart phone. And its not too big either, so it can be slipped into pockets. Go ahead and buy
it is an awesome phone the display is very awesome the camera is ok most of the games like temple run,sub way surfers,dead triger works well . the touch is really smooth. tthe looks is very good . i love it
I bought this one couple of weeks ago . Everything is good about this optimus till now. It is a fairly priced quality product from LG. Performance is good on a whole Screen - Resolution is very good at this cost. Batter - Battery is on lines of my expectation - Runs for little over a day. Apps - Good Regards, Kumar
You won't see such a good diplay for 10k. and good combination of hardware as well. build design is superb as well.
Using this mob for a day and find it extremely amazing. This is a best entry level phone at this price. Dont hesitate thinking its only 512 MB ram. Its GPU can handle pretty well with games. Experienced a bit of lag at very little instants. Other than that its an AWESOME mob... The looks are a KILLER...pretty and slim and best... The model seems to be available only online it seems; retailers doesnt seem to have this. And flipkart is as usual the cheapest and best...
MTK based Quadcores (A Chinese revolutionary component) are available for the same expense, This is a single core MTK Processor. Even if all the components are tailored well and serves satisfactorily, compared to many. - that doesn't mean .... Noteworthy aspects Good Display, Better GPU, Best Battery - A non-lagging and bright experience.
