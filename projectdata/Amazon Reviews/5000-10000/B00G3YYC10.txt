B00G3YYC10
I had ordered it for one of my relative. I used it for one day and I thought it performs well. I am giving it one less star because 3G is missing. Don't know how the handset will perform after 4-5 months. I will post a detailed review once I have the information...
Nice piece. features are good. only problem is battery. Needs charging more than once each day despite not using much
Cheap and best, camera is ok, but battery is not good, browsing speed is good, value for money, good one...
The instrument is lovely. but the battery life is short. i need to charge it twice in a day though i don't use it very much
Got this phone and look wise it's good but felt the signal is fluctuating badly and when reached to serive center for getting it rectifed got the response it's like that only and nothing can't be done. So really disappointed because this signal fluctuation leading to bad internet speed also.
