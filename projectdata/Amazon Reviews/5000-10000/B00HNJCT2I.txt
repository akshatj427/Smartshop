i have bought this Karbon Titanium S4 white @ Amazon ,It has many disadvantages 1- Battery Backup 2-3 hrs even though you wont do any thing 2- 13Mp camera no way , the quality seems to be 2 mega pixel 3- Now the comment i am writing will stun you hold your breath My phone slipped from my hand from less than 2 feet , the Lcd got damaged , i checked at various places no body has its original part.You have to got to Service center i waited for few weeks as the service center was 25 kms away from the city." Now the stunning part is i gave to the service center The service center guy checked the phone and asked me at what price u purchased is said 6999/- @ amazon. He laughed big and said the touch & display prices is 7999/- i was bowled.I told him what is this the phone i bought it for 6999/- he said yeah even i am shocked sir seeing the price of touch & display as you need to replace both. Now guys dont buy karbon phones less quality , cheaper price expensive spare parts no proper service.If you guys have any suggestions do let me know what to do with the phone its hardly one month i bought this phone..
Good phone at this price 6200
