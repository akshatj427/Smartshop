within 8k range>>> Pros. 1.Slim phone with aesthetic look,stylish design. 2.Kickass IPS display.(u cant even imagine such display quality within this range) 3.1.3 Ghz QUAD CORE processor. 4.Kitkat 4.4 4.Gesture Play & sensor like(ambient light,proximity,gravity) Sound quality is very good in speaker (although not too louder,even it comes with air tight earphone,great sound experience i must say) Camera quality is good (5 mp with led flash)..not bad in dark too..front is VGA.. Touch is also good Now, CONS. 1.512 MB RAM.....if u are nt a gaming person then not a prob bcoz. there is no lagging or hang problem. 2.Battery....very very POOR....hardly 24 hrs. 3.voice Calling quality over phone had a great lack of clarity... If u are ok with main this two con. then definitely go for it...u are going to have a great experience witin such budget with brand name like panasonic... all d bst >>>
Panasonic has pulled off a great phone! Moto G specs specs at moto E cost! Surprisingly, it has an IPS display! thats really good1 The only glitch here is the RAM!
as someone else has already said the only glitch is the RAM however there is no lag or other problems with the applications. not tested for games.
